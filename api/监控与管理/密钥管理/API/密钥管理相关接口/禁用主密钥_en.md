## 1. API Description

This API (DisableKey) is used to disable a CMK. A disabled key cannot be used for encryption and decryption. The ciphertext encrypted with the key cannot be decrypted until it is enabled again.

For more information on KMS request domain name API, see [region and domain name](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/573/8922).
> Whenever (including during internal trial) any public network downstream traffic is generated from the use of a public network domain name, a fee is charged. It is strongly recommended that users whose services are on the Tencent Cloud use **private network** domain names, because no fee is charged for the traffic consumed in the private network.

- Some of the input parameters are optional. Default value is used for those not specified.
- All the output parameters are returned to the user when the request is successful; otherwise, at least code, message, and requestId are returned.

## 3. Output Parameters
