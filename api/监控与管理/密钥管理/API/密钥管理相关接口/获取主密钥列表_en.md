## 1. API Description

This API (ListKey) </font>is used to display the key list of an account.

For more information on KMS API request domain name, see [region and domain name](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/573/8922).
> Whenever (including during internal trial) any public network downstream traffic is generated from the use of a public network domain name, a fee is charged. It is strongly recommended that users whose services are on the Tencent Cloud use **private network** domain names, because no fee is charged for the traffic consumed in the private network.

- Some of the input parameters are optional. Default value is used for those not specified.
- All the output parameters are returned to the user when the request is successful; otherwise, at least code, message, and requestId are returned.
