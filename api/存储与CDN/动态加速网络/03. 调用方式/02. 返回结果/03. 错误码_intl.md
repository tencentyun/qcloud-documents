## Common Error Codes

The error codes in the returned result indicate the result of the call to a cloud API. "code" is common error code, which applies to APIs of all modules. A code of 0 means the call is successful. Other values mean the call fails. If a call fails, you can find out the cause of the error and take appropriate actions based on the following table.

| Error Code | Error Type | Description |
|--------|---------|-------|

## Module Error Codes
"message" field indicates errors related to modules.
Example:
"message": "(2130) Invalid ProjectID parameter"
It consists of two parts - the string within () indicates the module error code, and the string following () is the error description.
The errors vary with different modules. You can identify the cause of an error based on error description. Some error codes of different versions may have the same meaning.
