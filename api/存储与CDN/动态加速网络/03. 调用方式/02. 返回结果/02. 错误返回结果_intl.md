If an API call fails, the error code in the returned result is a value other than 0, the message field shows the details of the error, and codeDesc is the error code on business side. You can find the details of the error on the Error Codes page based on the "code".

Example of returned error:

```
{
    "code": 4000,
    "message": "(2000) Accelerated domain name does not exist",
    "codeDesc": "InvalidParameter"
}
```
