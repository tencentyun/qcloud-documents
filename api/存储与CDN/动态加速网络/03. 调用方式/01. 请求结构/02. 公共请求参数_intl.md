Common request parameters are the parameters common to all APIs, and will not be discussed in each API document unless necessary. They are required in each request for the request to be initiated normally. The initial letter of each common request parameter is in uppercase so that it can be differentiated from API request parameters.

Common request parameters are as follows:

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Action    | String | Yes | The name of the API for the desired operation. For example, if you want to call the API [Query List of Accelerated Domain Names](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/570/13940), the Action parameter is GetDsaHostList. |
| Timestamp | UInt   | Yes | The current UNIX timestamp that records the time at which the API request was initiated. |
| Nonce     | UInt   | Yes | A random positive integer, which is used in conjunction with Timestamp to prevent replay attacks. |
| SecretId  | String | Yes | The SecretId that is applied for under [Cloud API Key](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/capi) to identify identity. A SecretId corresponds to a unique SecretKey, which is used to generate the request Signature. For more information, please see [Signature Method](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/570/13938). |
| Signature | String | Yes | Request signature, which is used to verify the validity of the request and is automatically generated by the system based on input parameters. For more information on how to generate a signature, please see [Signature Method](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/570/13938). |

**Example:**  
If you want to query the list of all domain names connected to CDN, the request link should look like this:
```
https://dsa.api.qcloud.com/v2/index.php?
Action=GetDsaHostList
&SecretId=xxxxxxx
&Timestamp=1465055529
&Nonce=59485
&Signature=mysignature
&<API request parameters>
```
A complete request requires two types of request parameters: common request parameters and API request parameters. Only five common request parameters are listed above. For more information on API request parameters, please see [API Request Parameters](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/570/13933) section.
