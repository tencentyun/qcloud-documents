A request for calling Tencent Cloud API is made up of the following elements:

## 1. Service Address
The service connection addresses of Tencent Cloud APIs depend on the modules. For more details, refer to the API descriptions.

## 2. Protocol
All Tencent Cloud APIs make communications over **HTTPS** to provide high-security channels.

## 3. Request Methods

Tencent Cloud APIs support both POST and GET requests.
**Note:**
1). These two methods CANNOT be used at the same time. If GET method is used, parameters are obtained from the Querystring. If POST method is used, parameters are obtained from the Request Body, and the parameters in the Querystring will be ignored. The rules for parameter formats are the same for both methods.  
2). If GET method is used, all request parameters need to be encoded with URL encoding. If POST method is used, this is not needed.

## 4. Request Parameters
Each Tencent Cloud API request should contain two kinds of parameters, common request parameters and API request parameters. Common request parameters are the parameters common to all APIs (see [Common Request Parameters](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/228/4473)), while API request parameters are parameters specific to each API.

## 5. Character Encoding
All requests for Tencent Cloud APIs and returned results use UTF-8 character set for encoding.
