## 1. API Description

This API (InquiryPriceResetInstancesType) is used to inquire the price of adjusting the model of an instance.

* Currently, using this API for inquiring about the price of adjusting models is only supported for the instances with a [system disk type](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/9452#block_device) of `CLOUD_BASIC`, `CLOUD_PREMIUM` and `CLOUD_SSD`.
* Currently, using this API for inquiring about the price of adjusting models is not supported for the [CDH](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/416) instances.
* Model adjustment is not supported for different models and systems, which means that the `InstanceType` specified when you use this API and the original instance model must be in the same series.
* For prepaid instances, fee deduction will be involved in using this API, so make sure to keep sufficient balance in your account. You can query the balance via the API [`DescribeAccountBalance`](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/4397).
