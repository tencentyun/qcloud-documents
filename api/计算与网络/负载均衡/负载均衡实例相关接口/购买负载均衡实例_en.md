When the API is successfully called, the unique ID of the CLB instance will be returned. Users can purchase CLB instances of the following types: public network application-based, public network-based with static IP, and private network-based. For more information, Please see [Product Type](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/1137).

## Input Parameters
The following request parameter list only provides the API request parameters. Common request parameters are required when the API is called.

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|--|
| loadBalancerType | Yes |Int| Network type of the CLB instance: <br>2: Public network-based, 3: Private network-based. |
| forward | No | Int | 1: Application CLB; 0: Conventional CLB (default). |
| loadBalancerName | No | String | Name of the CLB instance. It takes effect when only one CLB is created. The name can contain 1-50 characters, including letters, numbers, "-" and "_". <br>Note: If a duplicate name exists in the system, a random name is generated automatically.
| domainPrefix | No | String | Prefix of domain name. The domain name of the CLB instance consists of the domain prefix entered by user and the domain suffix automatically generated by Tencent Cloud to ensure the uniqueness. This field is not applicable to application-based CLBs. <br>The prefix can contain 1-20 characters, including lowercase letters, numbers and "-". This field is not applicable to private CLBs.<br> Note: If a duplicate domain prefix exists in the system, a random prefix is generated. For example, you only need to enter the prefix "xxxxx" for xxxxx.region.appId.clb.myqcloud.com.
| vpcId | No | String | ID of the network to which the CLB instance belongs. You can obtain it via DescribeVpcEx. If it is left empty or 0, the <a href="https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215" title="basic network">basic network</a> is used. |
| subnetId | No | Int | When you purchase a private network-based CLB instance within the VPC, you need to specify the subnet ID. The VIP of the private network-based CLB instance is generated from this subnet. This field can be left empty in other cases. |
| projectId | No | Int | ID of the project to which the CLB instance belongs. You can obtain it via <a href="https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/378/4400" title="DescribeProject">DescribeProject</a>. If it ls left empty, the instance belongs to the default project. |
| number | No | Int | Number of purchased CLB instances; default: 1. |





## Output Parameters

| Parameter Name | Type | Description |
|-------|---|---------------|
| code | Int | Common error code. 0: Successful; other values: Failed. For more information, please see [Common Error Codes](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/214/1530) on the Error Codes page. |
|message|String| Module error message description depending on API.|
| codeDesc | String | Error code. For a successful operation, "Success" will be returned. For a failed operation, a message describing the failure will be returned. |
| unLoadBalancerIds | Array | The array of the unified ID of the CLB instance. |
| requestId | Int | Task ID. |
|dealIds|Array| Reserved Field. |



## Example

Purchase three public network-based CLB instances with static IP:
```
https://lb.api.qcloud.com/v2/index.php?Action=CreateLoadBalancer
&<Common request parameters>
&loadBalancerType=2
&number=3
```
Response:
```
{
    "code": 0,
    "message": "",
    "codeDesc": "Success",
    "requestId": 3901942,
    "dealIds": [
        "3901942"
    ],
    "unLoadBalancerIds": {
        "3901942": [
            "lb-cjcymkw9",
            "lb-fpk0oxhp",
            "lb-ikpzv02x"
        ]
    }
}
```
lb-cjcymkw9 is the unified ID of the cloud load balancer instance you just purchased. Next, use API [Query the List of Cloud Load Balancer Instances](/doc/api/244/1261) to query whether the Cloud Load Balancer instance has been successfully created.
