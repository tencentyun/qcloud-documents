## 1. API Description

This API (ClearSubscriptionFilterTags) is used to clear up subscription tags.

Domain for public network API request: <font style="color:red">cmq-topic-region.api.qcloud.com</font>

Domain for private network API request: <font style="color:red">cmq-topic-region.api.tencentyun.com</font>

> At any time (including alpha test), any downstream traffic generated when using public network domain will incur traffic fee. It is strongly recommended that users on Tencent Cloud use **private network** domain, as it will not incur any traffic fee.

- The "region" should be replaced by a specific region: gz (Guangzhou), sh (Shanghai), bj (Beijing). The "region" value in the common parameter should be kept consistent with that in the domain. In case of inconsistency, the one in the domain should prevail. The request should be sent to the region specified by the domain.
- Requests for accessing via public network domain support both HTTP and HTTPS. Requests for accessing via private network only support HTTP.
- Some of the input parameters are optional, so the default values are not required.
- All output parameters will be returned to the user when the request is successful; otherwise, at least code, message, and requestId will be returned.
