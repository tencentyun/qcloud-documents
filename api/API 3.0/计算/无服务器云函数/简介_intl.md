Thank you for choosing Tencent Cloud Serverless Cloud Function (SCF). By hosting your code and using user-configured triggers, SCF automatically executes your applications based on the trigger event of the triggers, providing you with FaaS (Function as a Service) type services.

SCF is Tencent Cloud's serverless execution environment. With SCF, you don't need to purchase and manage servers. Instead, all you need to do is write the core code using the languages supported by the platform and set the conditions for code execution. After that, your code can be ran on the Tencent Cloud infrastructure in an elastic and secure manner. The underlying computing resources and tasks are fully managed by Tencent Cloud, including maintenance of server CPUs, memories, networks and other configurations/resources, code deployment, elastic scaling and load balancing. The code is executed on demand and there is no charge when it is idle.
