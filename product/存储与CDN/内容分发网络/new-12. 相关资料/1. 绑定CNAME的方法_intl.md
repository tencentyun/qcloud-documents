After CDN connection is approved, the system will automatically assign a CNAME domain (*.fast.cdntip.com). Please go to your domain service provider to complete configuring the CNAME. (CNAME domain is not directly accessible.)

Verify that CNAME is in effect

The time needed for the CNAME to take effect varies for different DNS service providers (usually within 30 minutes). You can also check whether a CNAME is in effect by using PING. If you are directed to the domain suffixed with "tcdn.qq.com" by using PING, the domain CNAME is already in effect.
