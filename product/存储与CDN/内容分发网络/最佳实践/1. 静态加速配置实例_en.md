+ You can implement access control by filtering the sources of user request, to avoid unwanted loss caused by malicious consumption. CDN provides the following two ways to implement access control:
	+ [Hotlink protection](): Source control is implemented by filtering the referer value in the HTTP Request.
	+ [IP blacklist and whitelist](): Source control is implemented by filtering the source IP of the request.

+ [HTTPS configuration](): You can provide HTTPS data encryption services to protect your users' data by uploading your own certificate/private key to Tencent Cloud CDN or using a free third-party certificate provided by Tencent Cloud.
