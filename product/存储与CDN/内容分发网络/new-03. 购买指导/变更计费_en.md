If you find that the billing model you selected is not applicable to your actual business during your use (For instructions on how to make the judgment, refer to [Billing Options](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/228/2949)), you can change the billing model as follows:

1. Log in to Tencent Cloud [CDN Console](https://console.qcloud.com/), and click **Change** at the upper right corner:

**Note:**

+ The billing method based on which the charge for the current date is calculated the next day shall be subject to the one used for the consumption generated on the current date.
+ **If you are a key customer with a contract entered into with Tencent Cloud, you can change the billing method by contacting your key customer manager, calling 4009-100-100, or submitting tickets, etc.**


**Examples:**
>Example 1: If the original billing method is "Pay by Bandwidth" on the current date, then it is changed to "Pay by Traffic" when there is no consumption generated;
>Billing method: The settlement for this day will be made based on "Pay by Traffic" the next day, provided that the billing method remains unchanged after this change.

>Example 2: If the original billing method is "Pay by Bandwidth" on the current date and consumption has generated before it is changed to "Pay by Traffic"; 
>Billing method: The settlement for this day will be made based on "Pay by Bandwidth" the next day, provided that the billing method remains unchanged after this change. When the settlement for the next day is made on the third day, "Pay by Traffic" will be used.
