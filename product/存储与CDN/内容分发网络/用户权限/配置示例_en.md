## Note

+ You can make division of permissions for the policies associated with existing sub-users;

+ The permission level of Default Administrator is higher than that of Project Administrator, which is higher than that of normal sub-user. If policy, project management policy and CDN policy are all associated with a sub-user, the sub-user has a combination of all of the permissions.
