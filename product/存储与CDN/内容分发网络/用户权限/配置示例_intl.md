The setting of Super Administrator is completed now. You can log in to Tencent Cloud official website for management using the Login Account. The setting procedure for other default administrators is the same as this process.

## Note

+ You can make division of permissions for the policies associated with existing sub-users;

+ The permission level of Default Administrator is higher than that of Project Administrator, which is higher than that of normal sub-user. If policy, project management policy and CDN policy are all associated with a sub-user, the sub-user has a combination of all of the permissions.
