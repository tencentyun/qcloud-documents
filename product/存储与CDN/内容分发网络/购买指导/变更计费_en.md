**Examples:**
>Example 1: If the original billing method is "Pay by Bandwidth" on the current date, then it is changed to "Pay by Traffic" when there is no consumption generated;
>Billing method: The settlement for this day will be made based on "Pay by Traffic" the next day, provided that the billing method remains unchanged after this change.

>Example 2: If the original billing method is "Pay by Bandwidth" on the current date and consumption has generated before it is changed to "Pay by Traffic"; 
>Billing method: The settlement for this day will be made based on "Pay by Bandwidth" the next day, provided that the billing method remains unchanged after this change. When the settlement for the next day is made on the third day, "Pay by Traffic" will be used.
