If you wish to use Tencent Cloud's [Cloud Object Storage](https://www.qcloud.com/product/cos.html) due to limited capacity of your business server, or if you're already using Tencent Cloud's Cloud Object Storage, you can directly use COS origin as the origin type and connect your domain to CDN.

## STEP One: Connect a Domain
Log in to [CDN Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cdn) and click **Create a distribution** in the **Domain Management** page:

## STEP Two: Enter Basic Information
Step 1. Enter the acceleration domain in the **Domain** field. The following conditions must be met:

+ The domain has been recorded by MIIT;
+ The domain has not yet connected to any Tencent Cloud CDN.

Support batch connection, up to 10 domains at a time.

Step 2. Select a content type in the **Content type** field:

+ Static content: Domains of this content type will be placed into the CDN static acceleration pool. This is recommended if your origin server falls into the category of website, e-commerce, game or image;
+ Media streaming: Domains of this content type will be placed into the CDN streaming media acceleration pool. This is recommended if your origin server falls into the category of LVB or ILVB;
+ Downloading: Domains of this content type will be placed into the large file downloading acceleration pool. This is recommended if your origin server falls into the category of mobile phone firmware, audio & video source file or game installer distribution.

Step 3. In the **Project** field, select the corresponding project for the domain to manage sub-projects. The projects here are shared for all Tencent Cloud products, you can add projects in [Project Management](https://console.qcloud.com/project);

Step 4. Select **Object storage (COS)** in **Origin type** and select the corresponding origin server bucket:

+ **The project for the domain must be the same as corresponding COS origin bucket project for ease of business management;**
+ Once you have selected bucket as the origin server, you can manage the content of the origin server in [COS Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cos);
+ If there is no bucket in the corresponding project when you select the COS origin, you will need to log in to [COS Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cos) to create a bucket.

## STEP Three: Enter Configuration Information

Step 1. Choose whether to enable parameter filtering in **Basic Configuration**;

Step 2. In **Cache expiration configuration**, CDN has the following two default cache time configuration:

+ The default cache time for all contents is 30 days;
+ The cache time for dynamic files such as .php, .jsp, .asp, .aspx is 0 second since such files will not be cached by default, but directly go back to the origin;

You can customize your configuration based on specific content type;

Step 3. Users can configure referer blacklist and whitelist in the **Hotlink protection** to restrict the access source.

## STEP Six: Configure CNAME
You can view the acceleration CNAME (suffixed with **.cdn.dnsv1.com**) that CDN has assigned to your domain in the status displayed in step 5. You will need to go to the DNS service provider of the connection domain (such as Dnspod) and add a CNAME record for the domain. Acceleration service will become available once **this DNS configuration takes effect**. (How to configure? [Click here](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/228/3121)).
