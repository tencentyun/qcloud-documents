If you already have a stable business server (origin server), you can connect to the CDN using own origin without modifying the origin server and enjoy acceleration service after completing CDN console connection process and DNS configuration. Please proceed as follows:

## STEP One: Connect a Domain
Log in to [CDN Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cdn) and click **Create a distribution** in the **Domain Management** page:

## STEP Two: Enter Basic Information
Step 1. Enter the acceleration domain in the **Domain** field. The following conditions must be met:

+ The domain has been recorded by MIIT;
+ The domain has not yet connected to any Tencent Cloud CDN.

Support batch connection, up to 10 domains at a time.

Step 2. Select a content type in the **Content type** field:

+ Static content: Domains of this content type will be placed into the CDN static acceleration pool. This is recommended if your origin server falls into the category of website, e-commerce, game or image;
+ Media streaming: Domains of this content type will be placed into the CDN streaming media acceleration pool. This is recommended if your origin server falls into the category of LVB or ILVB;
+ Downloading: Domains of this content type will be placed into the large file downloading acceleration pool. This is recommended if your origin server falls into the category of mobile phone firmware, audio & video source file or game installer distribution.

Step 3. In the **Project** field, select the corresponding project for the domain to manage sub-projects. The projects here are shared for all Tencent Cloud products, you can add projects in [Project Management](https://console.qcloud.com/project).

Step 4. Select **Own origin** in the **Origin type** and enter origin information at the origin IP address or domain field. The IP address and origin domain need to meet the following conditions:

+ For origin domain, the domain **must not** be the same as the connecting domain (the connected acceleration domain) and the ports (**1-65535**) using "domain:port" is supported;
+ For origin IP, multiple origin IPs and custom ports (**1-65535**) using "IP:port" are supported. When entering multiple IPs, back-to-origin requests will access each IP in sequence;
+ Cannot enter private IPs.

## STEP Three: Enter Configuration Information

Step 1. Choose whether to enable parameter filtering in **Basic Configuration**;

Step 2. In **Cache expiration configuration**, CDN has the following two default cache time configuration:

+ The default cache time for all contents is 30 days;
+ The cache time for dynamic files such as .php, .jsp, .asp, .aspx is 0 second since such files will not be cached by default, but directly go back to the origin;

You can customize your configuration based on specific content type;

Step 3. Users can configure referer blacklist and whitelist in the **Hotlink protection** to restrict the access source.



## STEP Four: Confirm the Information
Verify basic information and configuration. Click "Back" to modify, or "Submit" if all information is correct:

## STEP Five: Confirm the Status

The domain will be added once submitted. Please wait for the domain configuration (about 10 minutes):

You can also check whether the status of your domain is "Activated" in the **Domain Management** page.




## STEP Six: Configure CNAME
You can view the acceleration CNAME that CDN has assigned to your domain in the status displayed in step 5. You will need to go to the DNS service provider of the connection domain (such as Dnspod) and add a CNAME record for the domain. Acceleration service will become available once **this DNS configuration takes effect**. (How to configure? [Click here](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/228/3121)).
