CDN has been connected to the new version of Cloud Resource Access Management system, which divides all the CDN operations based on different feature attributes. The permissions for each feature involve **Console Operation** and **Cloud API Operation**. The creator can configure a feature (or multiple features) and what are allowed to be operated for the feature (project/domain) for sub-users as required.

**Note**: The old collaborator cannot generate key pair to call the API operation. After this upgrade, any sub-user can use his or her own key pair to call the API he or she has the permission to use.

## Features for Administrators
### Creator

Creator is the owner of Tencent Cloud account and has the highest permission.

### Default Administrators
The creator can also set the following administrators by associating with **Default Policies** (For more details, refer to [Permission Policies](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/228/6690)):

+ Finance Administrator
+ Super Administrator
+ Cloud Resource Administrator

Super administrator owns all the permissions of creator and can assign other sub-users, and cloud resource administrator has the permission to manage all cloud resources but cannot create other sub-users. Some features are provided only for default administrators, as shown below:

+ Use **Cloud API** [DescribeCdnHosts](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/231/3937) to get details of all domains under the account;
+ Switch between projects of a domain using **Cloud API** [UpdateCdnProject](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/231/3935) or in **CDN Console**;

For instructions on how to configure default administrators, refer to [Default Administrator Configuration Example](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/228/6693).


### Project Administrator
In addition to default administrators, permission can be assigned to project administrator based on project dimension. Project administrator can manage all cloud resources in specified project.

Project administrator can be assigned by using the policy with a service type of **Project Management** in **Custom Policies**. The policy has two features:

+ Manage could resources in CDN projects
+ Manage could resources in other projects

The permission of project administrator is equivalent to that of the old **Project Collaborator**, which allows allocation of resources in the Console among the projects covered by the permission.

Since the division of projects is applicable to all cloud resources, you can select the business scope of project management as required. For instructions on how to make the configuration, refer to [Project Administrator Configuration Example](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/ 228/6693) 


## Features for Sub-users
