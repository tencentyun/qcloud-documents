Please note that, in Tencent Cloud COS, the Bucket names under all the projects with the same APPID must be unique.

Click **OK**, and the newly created Bucket will then display in the Bucket list on the page:

## Deleting a Bucket

Users can delete empty Buckets easily. But when a Bucket is not empty, the user must empty all the objects and directories in the Bucket before deleting it.

Enter the COS console, click **Delete** under the Operation column on the right side of the Bucket you need to delete:
