Enter the COS console, click "Monitor Report" on the left, and select "Basic Data Statistics" to enter the page of Bucket basic data statistics.

Users can switch projects and Buckets on the right of the page, and then select the time you want to query. The basic data statistics includes: storage volume, the total number of Objects, public network access traffic, private network access traffic, CDN back-to-origin traffic, and the number of read and write requests. Except the total number of Objects, the daily trend of other data can be queried.
