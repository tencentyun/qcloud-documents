## Billing Cycle

COS is a postpaid service which charges on a monthly basis according to your actual usage amount. The bill for the current month will be generated between the 3rd and 5th day of the next month.

## Balance Freeze

When the cost for the current month has been cleared, an amount of 120% of the postpaid amount will be frozen as the expense for the next month. This frozen balance will be unfrozen on the account day of the next month, after which the usage cost for that month will be worked out and deducted. When the cost has been cleared, an amount of 120% of the deducted balance will be frozen as the expense for the next month.

## Termination

After the cost is worked out on the account day (3rd-5th day of each month), if your account balance falls below zero, the system will send an email and an SMS, notifying you to pay the overdue balance. If it is still not paid on 21th, your COS service will be terminated. When this happens, the user will no longer be able to perform read/write actions or access files in the COS. However, files stored in the COS will be retained for one month.
