## Billing Method
COS Standard is billed monthly, postpaid based on actual usage. The billing is done between the third and fifth day of each month. During this time, the previous month's fees will be calculated to generate the bill.
## Billing Information
Bills for COS are generated monthly. The regions supported in the Chinese mainland include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. For more information on supported regions, please see [Available Regions](/doc/product/436/6224).
Different Tencent Cloud products within the same region access each other over a private network by default and no traffic fees are charged for these connections. For this reason, we recommend selecting the same region when purchasing different Tencent Cloud products to generate cost savings.
> To determine whether the private network is used for CVM connections to COS, for example:
> Perform a ping on the COS domain name from CVM. If a private IP is returned, it means the CVM and COS connect to each other over the private network. Otherwise, the connection is made over the public network.
> Generally, a private IP address takes the form of `10.*.*.*` or `100.*.*.*`.
