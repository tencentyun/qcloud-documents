You can delete the file that has been uploaded to the Bucket on the page.

Enter the COS console, go to the Bucket of the file to be deleted, and click **Delete** in the operation column on the right side of the file.

Click **OK** to delete the file. The original URL of the file becomes invalid immediately after the deletion. The feature of batch deletion is currently not supported for the Bucket console. A batch deletion tool based on Python is available in the developer tools.
