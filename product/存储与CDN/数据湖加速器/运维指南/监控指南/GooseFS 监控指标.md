## 监控指标概述

Goosefs 监控指标记录了客户端、集群、Master 节点、 Worker 节点、进程的运行状态。

1. 按照统计维度，监控指标可以分成以下四大类：
 - **Gauge**：记录一个事件的瞬时数值，该数值可增可减，一般用来反映系统运行状态。
 - **Meter**：统计事件频率，即固定时间周期内事件的发生次数，如每分钟、每5分钟，每15分钟内的请求数。
 - **Counter**：统计事件发生的总次数，与 Gauge 不同的点在于该数值只增不减，一般用来记录访问请求次数等数据。
 - **Timer**：统计事件的频率和分布情况，该指标可以认为 Histogram 指标和 Meter 指标的结合，Histogram 指标用于统计耗时分布，Meter 指标用于统计 QPS；如果需要同时统计频率和耗时的时候可以使用该指标。

>!更多监控指标分类可参见 [Metrics Library 文档](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/getting-started)。GooseFS 目前提供的监控指标只有上述4种类型。

2. 按照数据采集来源，监控指标可以分为以下两大类：
 - **集群状态指标**：集群状态指标包括了 Cluster、Master 和 Worker 维度的监控数据，这些监控指标可以反应整个集群及集群下的每个节点的运行状态。这类指标的记录格式如下：
```plaintext
Master.[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...
[Worker_ip].[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...
```
 - **进程处理指标**：进程处理指标用于详细记录集群中的请求次数、延迟、CPU 消耗、RPC 调用次数等信息，这类指标可以推送到第三方监控工具中展示。这类指标的记录格式如下：
```plaintext
[processType].[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...[hostName]
```

## Cluster 监控指标

GooseFS 集群化部署时，客户端和 Worker 节点会周期性地通过心跳将监控指标发送到 Master 节点，可以通过 goosefs.master.worker.heartbeat.interval 和 goosefs.user.metrics.heartbeat.interval 分别设置 Worker 节点和客户端监控指标的心跳周期。

Cluster 级别的监控指标列表如下：

## 进程监控指标

进程监控指标可以在 Cluster、Master 和 Worker 中收集并汇聚。主要包括 JVM 信息、垃圾回收信息、内存占用信息三大类。

JVM 信息包括以下内容：

| **指标名称** | **指标描述**           |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| name         | The name of the JVM    |
| uptime       | The uptime of the JVM  |
| vendor       | The current JVM vendor |

垃圾回收监控指标包括以下内容：

| **指标名称**       | **指标描述**                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| PS-MarkSweep.count | Total number of mark and sweep  |
| PS-MarkSweep.time  | The time used to mark and sweep |
| PS-Scavenge.count  | Total number of scavenge        |
| PS-Scavenge.time   | The time used to scavenge       |

内存占用监控指标记录了内存使用情况的概述和详情信息，部分监控指标如下：
