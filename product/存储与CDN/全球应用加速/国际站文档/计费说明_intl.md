## Billing Items
GAAP is a pay-as-you-go product with charges including two parts: connection fee and bandwidth fee, as described in detail below:

- **Connection fee:** The cost of resources (direct connect, forwarding server, etc.) used in the creation of an acceleration connection, which is charged based on the concurrence capability of the connection. Each connection is billed independently on a daily basis.

- **Bandwidth fee:** The cost of bandwidth consumed by an acceleration connection. Each connection is billed independently on a daily basis according to the price range within which the actual peak bandwidth falls using tiered prices.

>**Note:**
>A disabled connection will not generate bandwidth fee but will incur a connection fee unless it is deleted.

## Arrears
When your Tencent Cloud account is in arrears, the Tencent Cloud may notify you of this through SMS, email and other means. A 24-hour grace period is provided for you, and if you fails to make the payment within 24 hours, your GAAP service is suspended after 24 hours.
>**Note:** Acceleration connection-related configuration information, such as listeners and origin servers, are kept for 7 days. The GAAP service will be resumed if it is renewed within 7 days, otherwise, the acceleration connection will be terminated and will not be resumed.
