## Overview

When using LogListener to collect logs in the mode of full-text in a single line, \n is used as the terminator of a log, and each log has a default key \_\_CONTENT\_\_. The log data itself is not processed in a structured way. For example, if your raw log `10002345987;write;error;topic does not exist` is collected in the mode of full-text in a single line, then the log is stored as `_CONTENT_:10002345987;write;error;topic does not exist` on the CLS platform.

## Configuration Steps

1. Go to the log topic for which the mode of full-text in a single line needs to be configured. On the configuration page, edit the collection configuration and configure the collection path and server groups.

2. Configure the key value extraction mode: Full-text in a single line.

   > **Note:** In the mode of full-text in a single line, **the log data time is the collection time.**

3. Configure filter (optional): Collection configuration filter allows you to filter the collected data. Any log data that meets the specified rule is discarded and is not collected to the platform. Log filtering can help you save traffic generated by invalid data during log collection. Filtering rules support **regular expressions**.![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/4ccce4e06d7e43a53379595ea4494afd/image.png)
