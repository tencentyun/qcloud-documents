You can download the detailed log containing the information about users' access to a connected domain for analysis. DSA provides domain logs on an hourly basis. You can download DSA logs for the last 40 days.

## Log Download

If there was no request for the domain in the date range, no log would be generated. In this case, **No Data** will appear.
> **Note:**  
> + DSA logs are provided on an hourly basis by default, with 24 log files generated each day. If there was no request for the domain in that hour, no log data packet would be generated.  
> + The latency of DSA logs is around half an hour.

## Note
The bandwidth or traffic data recorded in logs is the returned data at the application layer (HTTP protocol). It is smaller than that calculated at TCP layer due to such mechanisms as TCP protocol packet loss, three-way handshake and retransmission.

## Oversea DSA Log Download
Oversea DSA is in internal trial. You can apply for oversea log service via Ticket System if you have activated oversea DSA feature. Oversea log service is provided separately.
