### In Arrears and Out of Service
When your Tencent Cloud account is in arrears, the system will remind you of this through email, SMS and other means. Given the factors such as holidays, a 7-day grace period is provided for you, and if you fail to make the payment within the seven days, your HttpDNS service will be suspended on the 8th day.

### Restarting Service
When the HttpDNS service is suspended, your account ID and configuration information are kept for six months, during which you can restart the service at any time.
