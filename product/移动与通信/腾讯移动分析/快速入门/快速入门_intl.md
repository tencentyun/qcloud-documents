### Obtaining APPID

After creating a product successfully, you will get a corresponding APPID which is used to uniquely identify your product. If multiple products use the same APPID, the data will be counted only under this APPID. It is recommended to apply for different APPIDs for different platform applications (do not use the same APPID on Android and iOS).
