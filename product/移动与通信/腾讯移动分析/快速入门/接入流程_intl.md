### 1. Log in to account and create application
First, log in to the [MTA official website](https://mta.qq.com/), complete the profile and create an application on [My Applications](http://mta.qq.com/mta/overview/ctr_all_app_new) page to obtain APPID.
>**Note:**
>To avoid inconvenient application handover due to departure of personnel, it is recommended that developers register an account with their enterprise emails or public emails.

### 2. Download and integrate SDK
Download SDK on the [SDK download page](http://mta.qq.com/mta/ctr_index/download) and integrate it. Make sure that the APPID is correctly configured.
### 3. Add test device
Configure your test device on the [Add Test Device](http://mta.qq.com/mta/debug/ctr_equipment?app_id=3101737851) page. Through real-time debugging, you can verify whether the integration is correct and ensure that test data is isolated from online data.
### 4. Check if test data exists
Use the test device to install and launch App, and view test data on the [Real-time Log](http://mta.qq.com/mta/debug/ctr_realtime?app_id=3101737851) page.
