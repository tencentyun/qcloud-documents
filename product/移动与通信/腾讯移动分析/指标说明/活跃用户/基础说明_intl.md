### Metric Definition

Active users refer to the devices on which the App has been launched and App pages have been browsed for the current statistical period. MTA counts active users based on whether a user/program reports logs in different scenarios.

### Update Frequency

The data of daily active users is updated in real time, and that of weekly active users (WAU) and monthly active users (MAU) is updated the next day.

>**Note:**
>For some App users, data reporting may be unable to be completed on the same day due to the network environment. MTA will add and update data within seven days. Therefore, it is normal for the data of active users to increase the next day.
