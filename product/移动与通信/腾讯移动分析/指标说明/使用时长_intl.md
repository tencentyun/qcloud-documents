### Basic Descriptions
**Metric Definition**
Duration per use refers to the time period from entering the App frontend to leaving the frontend (one page is opened in one screen by default).
**Update cycle**
The usage duration data are updated the next day, namely, the data generated in the previous day are updated on a daily basis.

### Detailed Rules
**Usage duration**
The usage duration starts to be calculated after the App is opened and the usage duration is greater than 0 second. If the App is closed by users or runs in the backend for over 30 seconds, the App can be regarded as terminated.

**Average duration per use**
Average duration per use = Usage duration/Launch count

**Per capita usage duration**
Per capita usage duration = Visit duration/active users

**Special Apps**
The business characteristics of special Apps determine that some types of Apps have to reside in the backend all the time, such as map, security, music, FM and tool Apps (IME or weather forecast), and the time spent both in frontend and backend will be counted into the usage duration.

| Network Status | Scenario | Scenario Segmentation and Description | Typical Cases | Usage Duration |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Connected to network or network is down | Keep running at the frontend or backend | Map, security, music, FM and tool Apps (IME or weather forecast) | 14:05: Open Amap and navigate home.<br>14:06: Exit the frontend of Amap and open WeChat for chatting.<br>14:08 Lock the screen manually.<br>14:38 Terminate the map process running at backend. | Amap: 33 minutes (Unless terminated, processes running at backend are counted)<br>WeChat: 14:00-14:08 2 minutes |
| Connected to network or network is down | The App had been running at frontend. | Metro navigation Apps | 14:05: Open Amap and navigate home.<br>14:06: Exit the frontend of Amap and open WeChat for chatting.<br>14:08: Lock the screen manually.<br>14:38 Terminate the map process running at backend. | âˆš |
