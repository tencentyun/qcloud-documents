### Feature Overview
The user grouping feature helps operators and product personnel get a better idea of users, achieve targeted operation and optimize products. Product operators can use this feature to group users according to filtering conditions, such as user activity time period, registration time of new users and tracking behaviors via devices and developer's custom events. And then you will obtain the retention rate, user loss and return and user activity degree of this user group in your App.

### Advantages
- When creating the user group to be analyzed, you can filter users not only by time, activity degree, attributes of the device used by users but also through custom events. For example, you can filter out users who have purchased something in your App.
- When creating the user group, in addition to specific custom events, you can filter users by the funnel model. For example, you can filter the users who have triggered the events in the specific order of **User Registration** -> **Add to Cart** -> **Purchase**.
- After the user group is created, you can view user retention rate, user loss and return, user activity degree and other important information of this user group.

### Application Scenarios
- Help operators develop targeted operation strategies according to the user group characteristics.
Operators can develop the corresponding operation activities based on the user loss and return. For example, when the user retention rate decreases and the user loss increases, operators can hold more operation activities. Moreover, operators can judge whether the operation activity is successful or not according to the user return.
- Help product managers determine the direction of the product iteration optimization according to the user group characteristics.
Also, product managers can record the users who use the feature newly added in the iteration version, and classify these users into a user group, and then judge the usability of this feature by analyzing the statistical data of this group. For example, you can classify the users who use the WeChat [Shake] feature into a user group, and then judge this feature's usability by analyzing the user loss and return of this user group.
