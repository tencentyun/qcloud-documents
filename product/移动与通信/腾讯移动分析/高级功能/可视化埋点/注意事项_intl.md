If the device cannot be connected all the time, please check the following:
1. Make sure that you have entered the correct App for configuration without buried point.
2. Check whether the integrated SDK of the App is the latest.
3. Make sure that the device can accesses the network normally.
4. Check whether the screen is touched with fingers after the App is opened and the home page shows (gestures cannot be recognized on the loading/ad page).
5. Check whether the click effect on the App page is triggered when the screen is touched with four fingers (if there are too many controls on the home, you can search a page with simple elements for connection).
6. Check whether the startup method is correct. For iOS, the screen must be touched (for 3 seconds) with four fingers simultaneously within 10 seconds after the App is activated. If this process is not followed properly, you need to terminate the App process first and try again later.
7. Check whether the accessed third-party SDK gesture conflicts with the gesture used to activate MTA statistics without buried point.
