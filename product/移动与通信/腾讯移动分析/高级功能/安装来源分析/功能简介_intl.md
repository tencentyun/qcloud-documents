### Features
1. Support installation source analysis for all platforms (Android, iOS, H5 landing page). It can count the visits of each layer, thus reflecting the overall promotion installation effect.
2. Support multiple forms of landing links, including landing H5 (JS SDK must be integrated), application markets (App store, MyApp, etc.), and direct APK download.
3. Support real-time statistics. You can view the promotion effect on the real-time page upon the completion of integration, and then you can adjust the promotion strategies based on the real-time effect.
4. The full-link analysis from ad clicks to valid in-App conversion will be available soon.

**Tlink explanation:** After a promotion channel is configured, MTA generates a link for statistical analysis based on the App landing link you provided. You need to configure this link in the ad delivery system of the advertiser. And then the installation conversion effect of the corresponding advertiser can be counted with MTA.
