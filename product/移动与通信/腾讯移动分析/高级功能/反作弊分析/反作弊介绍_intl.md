## What is Cheating?
It is a way to create false new users, active users and so on through improper means with no interest on the App at all.
## Why Anti-cheating is Applied?
In the past, as traffic cheating is not widely known, people would not be suspicious of traffic if Ad/promotion/activity was working within the budget. But it gives opportunities to false traffic, and everyone in the supply chain is affected.
* Direct benefit loss: Traffic fraud can result in direct money loss.
* False data: False data cannot truly reflect the condition of the business, and can lead to loss of new business opportunities, decreased industry image and credibility.
