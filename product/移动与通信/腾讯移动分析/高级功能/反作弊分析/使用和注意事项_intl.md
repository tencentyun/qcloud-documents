After it is approved, you can view the data the next day.
If you do not integrate SDK, integrate SDK first. For detailed operation instructions, please see [IOS SDK Access Guide](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/549/12858) or [Android SDK Access Guide](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/549/12863).
## Notes
1. Not all types can be viewed
Because the acquisition and matching of abnormal types depend on the reporting of user accounts (especially mobile numbers). To ensure comprehensive abnormal types and accurate data, it is recommend that developers submit account numbers ([click to view how to submit accounts](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/549/13068)).

2. Channels that exist in abnormal channels may not be shown on the channel-based report.
This is generally because channels are hidden, and not all channels are shown on the channel-based report. But you can unhide it to view.
