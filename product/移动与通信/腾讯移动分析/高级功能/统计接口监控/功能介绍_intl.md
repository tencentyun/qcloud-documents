This feature is used to generate statistics on the application's call of an external API (especially network interfaces for such operations as connection, login, download, etc.). A developer who is using an external API can call this function to report some metrics. MTA will provide the statistics on the calls of the API and sends an alarm in case of any change of API availability. For an API with a large number of calls, data is reported on a sampling basis. The number of calls will be restored in the display page in Cloud Monitor statistics based on the sampling parameter.
