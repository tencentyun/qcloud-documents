Based on Tencent's 800 million QQ users, we have established a complete and reliable user profiling system that provides description of user characteristics including age, gender, region, education, device, preferences, etc. By presenting a full picture of users and ensuring accuracy and coverage, the system helps solve the cold-start in business, sparse profiling data and other issues, allowing developers to gain a clear insight into user attributes.
## Benefits of User Profiling
### Design products by focusing on user needs
Referring to user profile during design allows designers to focus on the target users' motivation and behaviors, instead of their own personal preferences, to enhance the user experience.

### Precise Marketing
Spending preferences and the requirements for the same product category vary widely with different users. Even the users who choose the same product of the same brand may purchase the product for different reasons. Categorizing users based on their demand characteristics and preferences makes it possible to easily identify different user decision models with little change for a targeted marketing, thus effectively improving marketing results and reducing marketing cost.
### Data application
Recommend users the products they want most (for example, Guess you like...) to provide individualized services.
### Enhance product value
Interact with target users in terms of the channels and product versions they prefer based on users' characteristics to deliver value-added services and achieve precise operation and marketing.
