| Characteristics of Loan Industry | Description |
| :---:|:----|
| Pay more attention to performance-related business data | User registration is only the start of using loan Apps. Generally, the ROI is calculated by the account user/loan user, and the KPI is determined by the actual loan amount.
| The cost of finding customers is higher than that of other industries; <br>the effective conversion rate (from registration to loan) is lower than that of other industries | The average cost of loan industry is about CNY 1,000 per person, and that of other industries is several hundred in CNY; <br>and if the conversion rate is increased by 1%, the loan amount will increase by hundreds of thousands (even millions) in CNY. |
| Business risk | In other industries, users need no longer to pay attention to the transaction after it is completed, but users in the loan industry need to check whether the loan is repaid normally, and are concerned with the overdue rate and so on, because users in loan transactions have risks, for example, a borrower does not repay the loan, or a borrower may be an intermediary seeking for cash. |
| Consuming status is consistent, but the feedback chain is long | A loan account has the status of account opening, loan, and repaying. However, account opening and loan need risk control review. It takes a long time (usually 2 to 7 days) from using the App to getting successful loan; and the App can learn about users' repayment and overdue conditions 30 days later after the loan is issued.	|
| Low use rate. It is difficult to learn users' characteristics. | The users in loan industry are goal-oriented. They use the products only when they need money. If there is no subsequent need, they will not use the product again (the use rate is even lower in automatic repayment service). |

Based on the features mentioned above, MTA provides the following solutions.

| MTA Solution for Loan Industry | Description |
| :----:|----|
| Carefully select key metrics related to loan business KPI/ROI | Based on the overall performance growth target, help business operators focus on the important data metrics for the target and the health conditions at the entire loan product level, and maintain an overall business view to operate with the purpose of promoting performance growth. |
| High cost of finding customers, and low conversion rate | Prepare 10 loan business funnels covering important business conversion points to help users quickly learn and locate issues, and then find optimized solutions based on problems, thus increasing conversion rate and reducing the cost of finding customers. |
| Comprehensive balance between performance and risk control data | Recreate the real loan steps used by users. Operators can intuitively focus on risk-related data (audit/overdue rates), learn the risk situation, and help optimize the unreasonable rules of risk control. With risk control, you can also focus on performance data. Based on business users, formulate more reasonable risk control rules (keep performance unaffected while preventing malicious users), and form a close business loop. Promote the healthy development of the entire loan business via data. |
| Users' status (account opening, loan, repayment, and overdue) data can be viewed and downloaded | The funnel can remove cross-day duplicates generated within 30 days. In combination with feedback periods (such as 7 days, 30 days), you can view the data of multiple status in the business data table to fully learn the complete chain data of the recent business. |
| Vertical profile of loan industry | Provide 39 profile tags for loan industry Apps. Coupled with business data (such as non-credit registration, no borrowing with available credit) to help Apps learn user characteristics. Loan profile can help design loan products and marketing campaigns that better suit the characteristics of people, or develop risk control rules that are more in line with demographic characteristics. |
