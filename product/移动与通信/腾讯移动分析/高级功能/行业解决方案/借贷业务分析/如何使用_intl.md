**Tips:**
1. It is recommended to report on the backend, rather than on the frontend, because reporting from the frontend may cause appkey exposure and make it easy for others to forge a reporting.
2. Product operation needs to filter the corresponding data sheet by comparing with the product data page, and then select the corresponding funnel, data sheet, event and data metric from the downloaded documentation.
3. There exists some discrepancy between the data metric and event name, because the data metric is mainly aligned with the concepts commonly used in the operated product, while the event name is used to facilitate the understanding of the buried points by technicians.
