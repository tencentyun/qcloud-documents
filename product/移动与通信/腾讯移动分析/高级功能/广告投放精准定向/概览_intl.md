**Ordinary advertising method:** Based on individual subjective understanding, choose the population tag provided by the advertising system, such as city, age, gender, interest and preference, and then deliver ads based tags.  
**Advanced advertising method:** It can avoid any misunderstanding on target product users of operators, and break the limitation of the advertising tag system. With MTA user grouping feature, it can select the highly valuable and active population in the App, and then push them to Tencent Social Ads for population dissemination, so as to obtain a user package with the same characteristics as the core user group. This user group is more interested in your product and has a great potential to become your highly valuable and active users (namely potential core users), thus resulting in a significant increase of ROI.
