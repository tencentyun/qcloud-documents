You can set attribute identifiers for your users, such as the membership level of game users, the accumulated spending amount of e-commerce users, AB grouping in common A/B Testing, etc., view the distribution of attributes or create user groups with different attributes via console, and conduct comparative analysis based on a full range of dimensions such as activity level, retention rate, churned users and user profile. 
**View user attribute distribution**
You can view the distribution of different user attributes in **Application Analysis** -> **User Mining** -> **User Profiling** -> **Custom Attributes**.

**Comparison of user behaviors between user groups with different attributes**
Set different user groups based on user attributes and conduct a comparison of results of their behaviors. For example, for User Group 1 and User Group 2 that use different ordering processes, conduct a comparison between them in terms of number of orders by clicks and number of users.
