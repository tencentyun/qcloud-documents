## Purchase China SMS Package
China text messages are billed on a prepaid basis by the number of messages sent. Before using SMS service, you need to purchase an SMS package. For more information, please see [How to Purchase SMS Package](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/13479). The available messages in the package are shared in all SMS application under your account.
>Note: Even though your Tencent Cloud account balance is enough, but if you have not purchased any SMS package, you may still encounter failure while sending SMS messages, and [the error code 1031](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/9559#.E8.B4.A6.E6.88.B7.E6.9C.89.E4.BD.99.E9.A2.9D.EF.BC.8C.E4.BD.86.E6.98.AF.E5.8F.91.E9.80.81.E7.9F.AD.E4.BF.A1.E8.BF.94.E5.9B.9E-1031-.E9.94.99.E8.AF.AF.E7.A0.81.EF.BC.88.E4.BD.99.E9.A2.9D.E4.B8.8D.E8.B6.B3.EF.BC.89) is returned.

## Complimentary China SMS Package
For postpaid users, 100 SMS messages are provided to your account free of charge in a form of package each month. This package is valid until 23:59:59 on the last day of the current month. The messages you sent are deducted preferentially from this package if it has enough messages for deduction. Otherwise, they are deducted from one of the packages you purchased which remains valid and has sufficient balance. If multiple packages are available for deduction, use the one you first purchased. If none of these packages is available, then a message indicating failure is returned.

## Using China SMS Package
The China SMS package you purchased takes effect in 5 minutes. Then, you can send SMS messages through the console or API. When the SMS messages are successfully delivered, a corresponding number is deducted from the available balance of the package.

## Reminder of Remaining Messages in China SMS Package
We will send you an alarm if the number of available messages in the package is lower than the number you set (which is 5,000 by default and can be adjusted based on your business needs), to ensure the normal operation of your business. Please purchase SMS packages in time.
