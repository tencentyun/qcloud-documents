Tencent Cloud ISMS provides a variety of services, such as verification code, system notification, and event notification, to meet the needs of enterprises for basic services and operational activities.

#### Signature customization
SMS signature is an identifier placed before the message body for identifying a company or business, which can be a company name, product name, website name, brand name, name of a WeChat Official Account or Mini Program or their abbreviation.

#### Message body template
Message body can be a verification code, system notification, and member marketing content. Templated SMS messages can be customized by use of parameters (variables). Templates are shared between China Short Message Service (CSMS) and ISMS messages.

#### SMS message delivery
After the message body template and SMS signature are approved, you can send SMS messages through the console, cloud SMS API or SDK.

#### Status notification
You can check whether an SMS message is sent successfully or not on the console, and the number of fragment messages (variable parameters in the body template will affect the final number of fragment messages).

#### Unauthorized usage prevention
Tencent Cloud ISMS features alarms for excessive message traffic on each calendar day. As soon as the number of messages sent by a user in one single day exceeds the preset volume, the system will trigger alarms that notify the predefined alarm recipients, helping to reduce or avoid losses caused by potential unauthorized usage.
