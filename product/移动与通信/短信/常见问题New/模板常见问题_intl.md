### Why is an SMS message rejected because of "Cannot send XX SMS messages"?

Check whether the template contains prohibited content. For more information, please see [here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/13444#audit-criteria-for-common-sms-messages).

### What SMS messages can be sent and what cannot?

Apply for signatures and templates by referring to [Standards on Signatures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/13444) and [Standards on SMS Messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/13444#audit-criteria-for-common-sms-messages).

### Is there any restriction on template name?

No. Enter a template name as needed.

### What should I enter in the remarks for template?

If the template is short or unclear and contains too many variables, or when the reviewer cannot confirm the content and the use of an SMS message to be sent, remarks are required to describe the application scenario. For example, if the template is: "Your verification code is {1}, which is valid for {2} minutes. If you are not using our service, contact the official customer service {3}.", the remarks for template can be: "Your verification code is 123456, which is valid for 5 minutes. If you are not using our service, contact the official customer service XXXX.".

### Can I directly put a link to the template parameters?

Template parameters should not contain any link, including short links. You are recommended to add an ICP licensed URL into the SMS message template and send the message upon approval.

### Is there a limit on the number of SMS message templates?
The number of SMS message templates is limited to 1,000. You can choose different templates to send SMS messages as needed.
