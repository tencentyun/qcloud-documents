### Can GVoice be used in the games released overseas?
Yes. GVoice has been deployed in dozens of countries and regions, and more regions will be available soon. The domain name of overseas server needs to be added in setserverinfo when the voice service is activated. Domain name address can be obtained (in both domestic and overseas regions) when voice service is enabled on the GCloud console. Domestic server is connected by default if this parameter is not specified.
### Which access node is selected when the same version of game is released in Hong Kong and Macao?
Hong Kong node is recommended.
