### What is the difference between the voice service in experience zone and the official service?
The resources of experience zone are limited, which can only support 100 voice DAUs.
### Can the service in experience zone be launched formally?
The voice service activated in the experience zone only supports 100 voice DAUs, and those beyond this quota cannot join the room. For the official launch of the game, an official service must be activated, and both gameID and gameKEY of the official service need to be set in setappinfo.
