(1) You can use the data encryption service normally within one month.
(2) If 1 month < usage period =< 1 month + 7 days, the service can still be used normally, and please renew as soon as possible.
(3) If 1 month + 7 days < usage period =< 1 month + 14 days, the service will be stopped, but the resources can still be retained, and please renew as soon as possible.
(4) If 1 month + 14 days < usage period, the service will be terminated, and the resources cannot be recovered. In this case, the service cannot renewed and the encrypted data cannot be decrypted.
You can view the current service status based on "Status" and "Expiration Time" on the console, as shown below:

> **Note:**
> If the service status is "To Be Renewed", you will receive an SMS notification that reminds you to renew in time to prevent your business being affected. If the service status is "Terminated", the service will be terminated. In this case, you cannot use the service again via "Renew" -> "Service", and the encrypted data cannot be decrypted.
