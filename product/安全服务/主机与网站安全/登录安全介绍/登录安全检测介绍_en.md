Based on user's common login location and malicious login source, the system analyzes the server's login log to identify the off-site and abnormal login attempts and notifies the user in real time. Through the analysis of server account login activities, the system sends real-time alerts to users on the suspicious login attempts.

With CVM's log query feature, users can compare their login activities against the records in the logs to identify abnormal login attempts and then take security measures.
