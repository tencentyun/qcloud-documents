Users may log in to their hosts from the Internet, which will create chances for criminals to break into the hosts by using brute force attacks. By using various methods, Tencent Cloud Security is able to check if a CVM has experienced brute force attacks intended to crack its password. When any exception is detected, user receives an internal message or SMS notification, and the security component tries to block any brute force attack. Users are provided with brute force attack prevention feature if they install Tencent Cloud Security component.
