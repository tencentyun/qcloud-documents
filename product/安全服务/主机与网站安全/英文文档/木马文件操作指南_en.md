 #### For malicious files detected by Host Security, you can perform the following operations:
1. **Isolate** 
If the files are malicious, you can select a single file to isolate it or select multiple files to isolate them in batches with one click. After isolation, the original malicious files are encrypted and isolated. You can filter the "isolated files" to restore them later.
2. **Trust**
If the files are non-malicious, you can select the "Trust" operation, and Host Security does not perform detection on the trusted files any more. You can filter the "trusted files" to manage them later.
