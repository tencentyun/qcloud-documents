A website backdoor trojan (also called webshell) is usually a dynamic script (such as ASP, PHP and JSP) placed by hackers after they manages to break into the website using certain vulnerabilities. The hackers can keep controlling the server through the backdoor trojan to upload/download files, execute commands and perform other malicious operations, which can be a great security threat to the website.
