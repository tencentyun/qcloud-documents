Users may log in to their purchased Tencent CVMs and use them through the public network. During this process, they may face security risks, such as unauthorized user's access to CVM due to password disclosure, or malicious cracking of weak password.

By comparing and analyzing information from user login channels, the login security feature detects and alerts any abnormal login risk issues, and provide users with guidance to repair the issues, thus guaranteeing user's ownership over the CVM.
