## Why WAF
In the following scenarios, Tencent WAF can effectively defense and prevent risks, and ensure system and business security of enterprise websites.
- **Data leakage (core information assets leakage)**: As a website is the entry of many enterprise information assets, hackers can steal enterprise information assets by means of web intrusion, resulting in incalculable losses to enterprises.
- **Malicious access and data capturing (unable to provide normal services while data is used by opponents)**: Hackers uses botnets to conduct CC attacks on websites, causing the websites unable to provide normal services due to resource depletion. Malicious users crawl the core content of websites (literature blogs, job sites, forum sites, and e-commerce comments) via web crawlers. Product details of e-commerce sites are crawled deliberately by competitors for research. Bonus hunters seek for arbitrage by searching for low-priced product information or obtaining marketing intelligence in advance.
- **Websites was hacked and tampered by trojans (affecting credibility and image)**: After obtaining permissions of websites or servers, attackers make users execute malicious programs by inserting malicious code to earn traffic and steal accounts and skills, insert links of "porn, gambling, and illegal activities", and tamper with webpage images and text. Operations of the site will be greatly impacted, and the reputation of the site operators will be damaged. External credibility and image suffer losses.
- **Framework vulnerabilities (attacked during patch fixing period)**: Many web systems are based on common open source frameworks, such as Structs2, Spring, and WordPress, which often carry security vulnerabilities. And it is really a hard time while waiting patches, because many attacks spring up soon after the vulnerabilities are published.
- **Illegal hijacking (hijacking cannot be perceived)**: Due to hijacking for the purpose of obtaining traffic, or increasing advertising revenue, the normal DNS requests of websites cannot be responded properly or the accessed content is maliciously modified. These are common hijacking activities on the Internet. Website operators usually cannot realize it before receiving customer complaints as they cannot perceive it from the server.
- **Service interruption caused by DDoS attacks with large traffic**: As a cheap and low-threshold attacking means, DDoS attack is often used to disrupt operations of competitors or to make key portals inaccessible, leading to significant impact on business continuity and brand image. And operators are often very passive when they are attacked.
