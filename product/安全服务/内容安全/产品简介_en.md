## What is Antispam?
Antispam is a security service provided by Tencent Cloud for filtering the illegal and harmful information of websites and Apps, including two sub-services â€” text recognition and image recognition. With Antispam, customers can be free from large-scale manual recognitions, and improve the recognition efficiency, purify the network environment, enhance the product experience and protect the healthy development of businesses, while minimizing the cost.

## Text Recognition
## Product Overview
With the vigorous development of Internet, users generate massive amounts of text contents, which inevitably include some spam texts. These spam texts may not only impact user experience, but also violate laws and regulations, and can even lead to website shutdown. Most of these spam texts are made by the professional practitioners in the black industry of Internet. In order to prevent customers from being distracted and restrained by the spam contents and to help them get liberated from the complicated confrontation with the black industry, BSP launched the text recognition service.
The text recognition service is suitable for website and App contents, including message posting, remarks, on-screen comment, chatting, etc. It can accurately identify the malicious texts and images, such as illegal contents, spam advertisements, malicious marketing contents, and can effectively minimize various types of illegal advertisements and pornographic or vulgar contents.

### Product Features
#### Anti-interference
To circumvent the blow of product security policy, the practitioners in underground industry often use symbols, icons, phonetic transcription, foreign languages and other methods to interfere with texts. It becomes difficult for the traditional text mining technology to effectively identify the "Psoriasis" advertisements in businesses. As an innovation, the anti-interference engine developed by BSP can convert the symbols, icons and other interferences in the contents and restore the original text contents through text preprocessing and OCR recognition, thus easily seeing through the "camouflage" of practitioners in underground industry.
#### Dirty Word Database
In addition to the original text restoration feature, BSP provides the fastest and most comprehensive dirty word scanning technology. Based on the most complete dirty word database in the industry accumulated by Tencent Ecology and the multi-Tree model matching technology, BSP text recognition service can provide the fastest, most comprehensive identification of malicious texts and advertising contents. The BSP dirty word database contains more than 30 categories and hundreds of thousands of keywords, ranging from the pornography, gambling to the unlocking, tea and other advertisements.
#### Underground Industry Characteristics
The BSP text recognition service has extracted three underground industry behavior characteristic models based on Tencent's years of experience in fighting against underground industry as well as characteristic collecting and intelligent learning. No matter what interference methods the malicious users continue to create, the characteristic fingerprint model of BSP can identify them.
- Device fingerprint database: BSP's massive underground industry database. It collects fingerprint information of PC, mobile phone, network and other devices from malicious users, so as to identify suspicious users on the device level, thus making it more difficult for users to conduct malicious operations.
- Text characteristics: BSP's textual characteristics mainly include profitability, redirection, noise and so on. Based on these textual characteristics and BSP text-mining capability, the text recognition service can detect suspicious contents. In addition to redirection, noise and other intuitive characteristics, BSP uses LDA to automatically explore more characteristics.
- Image redirection recognition: As a high-level confrontational behavior, image redirection is often used by the practitioners in underground industry. Now, the BSP text recognition API has integrated the OCR image recognition capability which has been used in QQ/Qzone and other Tencent products for many years and can effectively recognize advertising and pornographic images.
#### Risk Level
The BSP text recognition service supports three risk levels of user contents, i.e. malicious, suspicious and credible. It is recommended to adopt different policies for different risk levels.
- Credible: Operate the business normally.
- Suspicious: It is recommended to restrain such contents based on the user's behavioral characteristics, such as IP aggregation, content sent frequently.
- Malicious: It is recommended to directly restrain the business of this user.
#### Risk Notification
If the contents generated by users are found to be of the malicious risk level, the BSP text recognition service will explicitly inform the user of the malicious contents, including the hit keywords and categories.
