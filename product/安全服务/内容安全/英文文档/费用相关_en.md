# Can I try out BSP for free?

1. If you are an enterprise user, you can try out all the services of BSP (including CAPTCHA verification, image recognition, activity anti-cheating, registration protection, login protection, text recognition, and loan anti-fraud) for free, and the free trial period is 7 days for each service.
2. If you are an individual user, you can try out the CAPTCHA verification and image recognition services of BSP for free, and the free trial period is 7 days for each service.

## How to get the free trial?

Log in to [BSP Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tianyu/overview) and find the services that you want to try out for free. Click **Apply for Free**, and complete the follow-up operations according to the instructions.

## What to do if an unexpired account cannot be used during trial?

Such problem occurs when the usage exceeds the upper limit (the daily limit is the upper limit in the trial period). Once the upper limit is exceeded, the account cannot be used any more. If you have special requirements, you can apply for increasing the upper limit temporarily.
The limit for each sub-service is as follows:

| Service Item | Upper Limit |
|---------|---------|
| CAPTCHA Verification | 5,000 |
| Image Recognition | 2,000 |
| Activity Anti-cheating | 10,000 |
| Registration Protection | 10,000 |
| Login Protection | 10,000 |
| Text Recognition | 10,000 |

## How is BSP billed?

Each service of BSP is provided in packages, and each package has a daily usage limit. The usage is calculated based on the number of API calls, and the CAPTCHA verification service is calculated based on CaptchaIframeQuery.

## What's the price of Antispam?

For the price of Antispam, please see [Antispam Purchase Guide](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/669/14339).

## If the daily usage exceeds the package limit, will the service be stopped?

If the daily usage exceeds the package limit, BSP will stop the service. However, when your daily usage exceeds 80% of the package limit, you will be notified by the system via SMS, email, and other ways to adjust the package according to your business needs.

## Can I upgrade the purchased package if the usage exceeds the package limit?

Yes. The following two options are provided to meet different needs:

1. For the businesses with long-time heavy amount of usage, it is recommended that you upgrade the current package at [BSP Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tianyu/overview) to increase the package limit.
2. For the businesses with temporary heavy amount of usage, it is recommended that you apply to activate elastic defense by [submitting a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?level1_id=141&level2_id=151&level1_name=%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1&level2_name=%E5%A4%A9%E5%BE%A1%E4%B8%9A%E5%8A%A1%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E9%98%B2%E6%8A%A4%20BSP) to temporarily increase the limit.
