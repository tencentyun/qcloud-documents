Security Situation Awareness (SSA) provides three features: Security Situation Awareness Overview, Server Security Situation Awareness, and Network Security Situation Awareness. This document describes the application scenarios of SSA in terms of its features.

## Security Situation Awareness Overview

Security Situation Awareness Overview is used to display the overall security situations of your cloud resources, and help you understand the security of your resources. Specifically, it can:

- Display large-scope attacks in real time from brute force attacks and remote login;
- Prompt you about security optimization tasks;
- Summarize and display the number of server assets and type distribution, network security scores and risk prompts, user security scores and risk prompts, number of attacks and type distribution, and number of risks and type distribution.

## Server Security Situation Awareness

Server Security Situation Awareness is used to display the security situations of your server assets and provide data foundation for you to solve server security problems. Specifically, it provides:

- An overview on server vulnerabilities, brute force attacks, Trojan viruses and remote login, including the quantities, situation maps, the number of servers at risk, and other data;
- An overview on the online situations of server security agent;
- An overview on server security information, including network brute force attack situation maps, new high-risk vulnerability situation maps, and announcements about the prevailing high-risk vulnerabilities in the industry.

## Network Security Situation Awareness

Network Security Situation Awareness is used to display the risk status of your enterprise network security and help you find the weaknesses in your network security construction. Specifically, it can:

- Summarize and display DDoS attack traffic, the ranking of attacked IPs, main attack types, and the number of attacks in the most recent year;
- Summarize and display the quantity of Web application attacks, the ranking of attacked domain names, the distribution of attack types, and the number of attacks in the most recent year;
- Provide an overview on network security information, including whole-network DDoS attack situation maps, DDoS/DNS hijacking situation maps for key industries, and whole-network DNS hijacking distribution graphs.
