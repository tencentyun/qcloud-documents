## What will happen to my business when a brute force attack event is displayed in the Security Situation Awareness Overview screen?
Brute force attacks do not mean that the server has been successfully attacked by a hacker, but that a hacker is carrying out brute force attacks on your server, and this has been successfully detected by Tencent Cloud's security system.
