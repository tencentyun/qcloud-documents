The advantages of Host Security in comparison with other host security products are listed as follows:



| Feature | Host Security | Other host security products |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Hacker Behavior Detection |**Detects hacker attack attempts in real time based on Tencent's threat intelligence data sources across the network.** | Conduct analysis based on single server's behavior data with a lower ability of detection and slow response. |
| Trojan Detection | **Responds to unknown risks quickly by leveraging Tencent PC Manager's new-generation TAV antivirus engine and Hubble analysis system integrated at the back end; effectively defenses against encrypted and metamorphic malicious scripts using the WebShell detection engine based on machine learning.** | Inability to detect executable malicious files; the WebShell detection based on character matching using regular expression logic has a high risk of false positives and false negatives. |
| Free of installation and maintenance |**Associated with cloud platform server OPS information automatically and is ready for use upon the purchase of CVM; the security policy is updated automatically on the cloud, without the need to maintain various security detection scripts manually.** | Login to server and manual installation are needed; security policies need to be configured by the personnel who has adequate security expertise. |
| Centralized OPS | **Security incidents are managed centrally in the console, eliminating the need to log in to multiple servers; centralized management of server assets and rapid building of a security visualization OPS platform.** | User needs to log in to the server to handle a single security incident. |
| Low resource utilization | **With self-developed lightweight agent, most of the computing and protection activities are performed on the cloud with a low consumption of server resources.** | Client has a high memory consumption, which is more than 100 MB generally; the server performance is affected during peak hours of business. |
