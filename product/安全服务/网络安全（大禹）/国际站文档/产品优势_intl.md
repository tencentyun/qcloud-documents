High Defense IP is a paid anti-DDoS attack product provided by Tencent Cloud for all users. It supports all regions of origin servers. The product advantages are as follows:

## Easy Access Without Origin Server Restriction
No matter where the servers reside (on Tencent Cloud, on other private clouds, or in IDC), they can be protected with High Defense IP.

## Hidden IP of Origin Server
Hide the real IP of origin server by exposing the high defense IP as the business IP. Then attack traffic cannot directly reach the origin server, and the security of origin server is further ensured.

## 30-line BGP Line
It adopts Dayu defense bandwidth with a single IP integrating with multiple lines. The lines are reliable and have a large coverage. With the average access delay of less than 30 ms, it eliminates cross-network access delay and ensures a superior access experience.

## Ultra-large Bandwidth Defense
 With the single-point T-level extra defense bandwidth, it provides 300 Gbps + Dayu defense and 900 Gbps + single-line defense at a single point for a single customer to easily defend against DDoS attacks with large traffic.
		
## Leading Cleaning Capability
It owns self-developed defense cluster, applies multi-dimensional algorithms (such as IP profile, behavior analysis, cookie), and uses AI intelligent engine for continuous defense algorithm update, thus can effectively defend against all types of attacks.

## Multi-business Support
Support TCP/UDP protocols for full defense of web and non-web based business with best practices and solutions in the industry.

## Elastic Defense and Flexible Payment
When the attack traffic exceeds the package peak value, Tencent Cloud continues providing defense for users to keep the business uninterrupted. The part exceeding the package is billed by the actual attack traffic of the day.
