## Overview

Dayu Anti-DDoS provided by Tencent Cloud security is a network protection security product featuring DDoS protection and DNS hijacking detection.

DDoS protection includes DDoS basic defense (for all Tencent Cloud CVMs by default) and BGP high defense IP (for users with high bandwidth defense).

## DDoS Basic Defense	

All Tencent Cloud CVMs are under DDoS basic defense for free. IP blocking is performed when the public IP is under attack with peak attack traffic exceeding 2 Gbps. The general blocking duration is 2 hours. For large traffic attack, the duration is 24-72 hours.

## BGP High Defense IP

BGP high defense IP can provide ultra-large bandwidth DDoS and CC defense for Tencent Cloud users, with a capacity of up to 600 Gbps. 28-line BGP line access can eliminate cross-network latency and bring top-speed access experience.
