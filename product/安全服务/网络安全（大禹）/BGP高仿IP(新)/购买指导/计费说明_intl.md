## Alert of Expiration
Seven days before the High Defense IP service expires, you will receive an expiration alert message sent via **internal message**, **SMS and email**.

## Upgrade and Renew
- If you upgrade the minimal defense, extra fees will be charged. The defense can only be upgraded, but cannot be degraded.
- If your account balance is sufficient and auto renewal is enabled, the system will automatically perform renew on the expiry date.

## Reclaiming Mechanism
When the service expires, the system still provides the service for another 5 days and retains the configuration. If you do not renew within 5 days, the high defense IP will be automatically destroyed and the service will be terminated.
