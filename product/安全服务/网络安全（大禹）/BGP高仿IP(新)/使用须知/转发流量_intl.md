## What is Forwarding Traffic?
Forwarding traffic refers to the traffic forwarded from the high defense IP cluster to the origin server.

## How is forwarding traffic billed?
There are two payment methods for forwarding traffic:
- One is the one-off, bandwidth-based prepaid mode. For more information on the price, please see [Product Price](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/297/8799).
- The other is postpaid on a daily basis at the rate of 0.80 CNY/GB, and the bill is generated the next day.

## Differences of Two Payment Methods
- There is no forwarding bandwidth limit for the postpaid on a daily basis.
- For the one-off, bandwidth-based prepaid mode, if the business traffic exceeds the purchased bandwidth, the business access may be affected.
