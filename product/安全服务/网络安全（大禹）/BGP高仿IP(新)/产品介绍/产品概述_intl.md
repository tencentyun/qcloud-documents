## What is High Defense IP?
High Defense IP is a paid anti-DDoS attack product provided by Tencent Cloud for all users. It supports all regions of origin servers. With the Dayu line defense of up to 310 Gbps, it can easily and effectively defend DDoS and CC attacks to ensure stable and normal business.
## Which users is it suitable for?
- High Defense IP is suitable for all users to access. It supports all regions of origin servers and all business types. No matter where the servers reside (on Tencent Cloud, on other private clouds, or in IDC), they can be protected with High Defense IP.
- Users who need defense for website and non-website business.

## How Does it Work?
After users purchase High Defense IP and configure forwarding rules and domain name origin-pull, all access traffic flows through the High Defense IP cluster, and then is forwarded to origin server through the port protocol (both website business and non-website business are supported). The attack traffic will be cleaned and filtered in the High Defense IP cluster, and only the normal business traffic will be returned to the origin server to ensure the stability of the origin server service.

## Why High Defense IP?
- Hidden IP of origin server
     Hide the real IP of origin server of users by exposing the high defense IP as the business IP. Business of the origin server is protected because attack traffic cannot directly reach the origin server.
- Ultra-large bandwidth defense
     With the largest Dayu defense bandwidth in the industry, it provides a defense capability of up to 900 Gbps + to easily defend against DDoS and CC attacks.
- Quality access experience
     With Dayu defense bandwidth, it ensures extremely fast access experience using 30-line Dayu line.
- Flexible Billing
    It supports "minimal + elastic defense" mode, and the defense is billed by the actual attack traffic, which can save costs for users. For more information, please see [Elastic Defense](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/297/15554).
		
## What should be noted when using it?
High Defense IP achieves the defense by exposing high defense IP as the business IP to hide the IP of origin server. If the origin server has been attacked and exposed, it is recommended to replace the IP of origin server after purchasing the High Defense IP service to ensure the confidentiality of the origin server, that is, to prevent attackers from directly attacking the origin server.
