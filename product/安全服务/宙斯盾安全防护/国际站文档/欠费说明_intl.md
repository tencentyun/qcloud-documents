## **Alert for Expiry**
Alert notifications for expiry will be sent through email and SMS to Tencent Cloud account creators, global resource collaborators and financial collaborators within 7 days before the expiry of the prepaid cloud resources for Tencent Cloud Aegis Anti-DDoS.
## **Alert for Arrears**
Alert notifications for arrears will be sent through email and SMS to Tencent Cloud account creators and all collaborators upon and after the expiry of the prepaid cloud resources for Tencent Cloud Aegis Anti-DDoS.
## **Arrears Processing**
From the moment your account is charged and the balance becomes below zero, Aegis Anti-DDos' elastic protection will be disabled, but the unexpired monthly prepaid base protection and business forwarding will not be affected. After your account is topped up and the balance becomes above zero, the elastic protection will be automatically resumed.
## **Recycling Mechanism**
- The system will send you renewal reminders within 7 days before the expiry of the cloud resources.
- If the account balance is sufficient and you have already set automatic renewal, the system will automatically renew the resources upon expiry.
- If your cloud resources are not renewed before or upon expiry, the system will stop all high-defense capabilities upon expiry. The high-defense IP will only provide basic protection like regular IP, but business forwarding will still work normally.
- You can renew the resources and restore your data for protection with Aegis Anti-DDos within 7 days after expiry.
- If you fail to renew your cloud resources within 7 days after expiry, the system will release the resources at 00:00 on the 8th day after expiry and your data on the servers will be irreversibly purged.
