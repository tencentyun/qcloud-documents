#### What is Penetration Test?
Penetration Test completely simulates the attack technology and vulnerability discovery technology used by hackers, to deeply detect the security of target system and locate the most vulnerable processes of the system.
#### Is penetration test equivalent to system intrusion?
The biggest difference between penetration test and hacker intrusion is that the former is authorized by customers to use controlled and non-destructive methods and tools to discover vulnerabilities in the target and network devices. It helps managers understand what problems their networks are encountered. 
#### What risks can penetration test bring to the business system?
Many foreseeable and unforeseeable risks that cannot be avoided may occur in the process of penetration test. Therefore, implementation team provides solutions before the test to avoid significant impact on the system, for example:
- Perform the test on a test system instead of the system that is running formally.
- Back up important business system and data before the test.
- Prior to the implementation of a risky test, communicate with the business system admin for confirmation.
- Avoid performing the test during business peak.
- When an exception occurs during test period, the test is cancelled immediately and the system is recovered timely.

#### Does penetration test may cause disclosure of sensitive data?
A confidentiality agreement is signed before the implementation of Tencent Cloud Penetration Test, to strictly control the devices and information of security staff and ensure that customer data is strictly confidential.

#### If we cannot fix the vulnerabilities found in penetration test, can Tencent Cloud provide support?
After the penetration test is completed, a professional test report is generated and delivered to customers, which provides suggestions for how to fix the vulnerabilities. If vulnerabilities still exist, Tencent Cloud can help customers fix them.

#### How long does the penetration test take?
Generally, it takes about two weeks to conduct an advanced penetration test on a website.
It takes about 3 work days to perform a professional penetration test. However, the actual period depends on the on-site environment and the actual situation.
#### What preparations are needed before penetration test?
- Understand the customer's system network architecture.
- Clarify customer's network security level.
- Confirm the penetration target.
- Check whether the customer information is backed up.
- Select tools to help with penetration.
- Select the time for penetration.
- Ask the customer to sign the authorization for penetration test

#### Can I implement an on-site penetration test?
Tencent Cloud conducts on-site penetration test for customers whose business is deployed on private network, and conduct remote test for business deployed on Internet. The price for on-site test is higher than remote test. 

## Purchase of Service
#### How do I purchase Penetration Test Service?
Visit [Penetration Test Service](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/pt) page and submit an application. Then sales team and security experts communicate with you about your security requirements. After confirmation, Tencent Cloud negotiates with you on whether the test is implemented by Tencent Cloud or a third party recommended by Tencent Cloud. Upon acceptance of the service, you can pay service fees to Tencent Cloud.

## Implementation of Service
#### How does the penetration test work?
After being authorized by customers, the experienced security consultants or experts simulate vulnerability discovery technology and attack technology used by hackers as completely as possible, to find out all the potential security vulnerabilities within the controllable range, and provide customers with test reports and suggestions on security improvement.

#### How does Tencent Cloud protect customer information from disclosure?
- Tencent Cloud has a well-established information security service prevention and control system.
- Tencent Cloud obtains users' authorization and signs a confidentiality agreement with them before the implementation of Penetration Test Service.
- For internal system security, security devices are deployed at main egresses to test the confidentiality capability in terms of traffic, files, known behaviors and unknown behaviors.
- All the employees who provide external services sign the labor contract with the company. 

#### Are there any risks to the penetration test implemented through private network? Will the business system be affected?
No. Tencent Cloud Penetration Test Service comes with solutions to avoid risks. Test should be performed during off-peak hours, to protect the business system from interruption.

#### Both penetration test and security scanning are designed to locate vulnerabilities. Can I use only one of them?
- Concept of Tencent Cloud Penetration Test Service: After being authorized by customers, experienced security experts simulate the ways of attack used by hackers and perform intrusion test on all respects of enterprises' online platforms without the website code and server permissions, so as to assess the security of the business platforms and server systems of enterprises.
Tencent Cloud Penetration Test Service can discover customers' system security risks before hackers, and deploy defense measures in advance to protect every aspect of the system from hackers in the future. It can consolidate the trust of customers on enterprises and platforms, reduce unnecessary economic losses, improve user experience, and enhance users' trust and support for the platforms.
- Differences: In addition to locating vulnerabilities, Tencent Cloud Penetration Test Service also needs to further attack and exploit vulnerabilities, elevate their privileges, and maintain the control over the target system. In contrast, vulnerability scanning can clearly show all the vulnerabilities in the system, but does not measure the impact they have on the system. Penetration test is much more aggressive and attempts to attack the real production environment with a variety of methods. Instead, vulnerability scanning carefully scans and quantifies all vulnerabilities in the system in a non-aggressive way.

#### What do customers need to do when using Tencent Cloud Penetration Test Service?
- Provide the scope of penetration test.
- Authorize the penetration test.
- Provide test account in certain scenarios.

#### Can I use vulnerability scanning to perform real-time monitoring? Can I receive an alarm when a new vulnerability is found?
- Vulnerability scanning is different from real-time monitoring.
- Periodic scanning is supported for vulnerability scanning.
