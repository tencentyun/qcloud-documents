## Basic Concepts
### Vulnerability
Vulnerability, or weakness, plays an important role in security risks. Weaknesses can be used by threats to harm assets or business targets. Weaknesses exist in various assets such as physical environment, organization, procedure, personnel, management, configuration, hardware, software and information. 
However, without threats, weaknesses cannot cause damages to assets. They only serve as conditions or environments for threats to harm asserts. Weaknesses without security threats do not need security protection. 
### Penetration test  
Penetration test is a professional security service that deeply detects the security of the target system by simulating the vulnerability discovery and attack technologies that may be used by hackers to identify the most vulnerable part of the system. The penetration test can help managers understand what problems their networks are encountered. 
## Customer Benefits 
### Technology security verification  
As an independent security technology service, the penetration test is intended to verify the technology security of the target system and serves as an important approach to discover and verify system risks of customers' key businesses. The penetration test allows you to qualitatively analyze system security at technology level. 
### Detection of security risks  
The penetration test is conducted as such: The tester connects all the traditional security weaknesses to a path, and then acts as a hacker to intrude the system along the path. By simulating hacker intrusion, you can locate every security risk point, verify to what extend the risk point can be used, and find the most urgent one that the company need to deal with immediately. The penetration test result display your system security conditions in an intuitive way.
### Provision of security reinforcement basis  
The penetration test results as well as tool scanning results provide important data for future security planning and security reinforcement. The penetration test results can be used as examples for educating staff on security awareness. 
### Enhancement of security skills  
The penetration test service provides professional penetration test reports, which can be used for case study and learning of common security knowledge.
