## Service Classification
- The content of Tencent Cloud Penetration Test Service is customizable. The key direction of penetration can be adjusted and the test methods can be changed or reduced depending on the needs of customers.
- Penetration test is divided into general penetration and business logic penetration according to different test levels. The test can be performed on public cloud and private cloud based on the penetration targets. Details are shown in the table below:

## Test Classification
### White-Box Testing
White-Box Testing penetrator can obtain various data from the users who are under test in a normal way, to simulate the unauthorized operation of employees in the enterprise. The penetration test is performed from either outside or inside of the organization.
### Black-Box Testing
For Black-Box Testing, users do not provide any information other than the information disclosed by the test target. The information is initially obtained from the public servers such as DNS, Web, email. The penetrators generally perform the penetration test from the outside of the organization.
### Grey-Box Testing
Grey-Box Testing is a test between White-Box Testing and Black-Box Testing. Only few people in organizations that are under test are aware of this test. It is designed to detect whether the information security incidents in the organization of users are properly monitored, handled and recovered. 

## Service Process 
1. In the official website of [Tencent Cloud PenetrationTest Service](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/pt), click "Apply Now", then enter relevant information and submit the application. 
2. After the online application is completed, Tencent Cloud security experts and sales team will communicate with you to confirm your requirements and provide service and pricing information.
