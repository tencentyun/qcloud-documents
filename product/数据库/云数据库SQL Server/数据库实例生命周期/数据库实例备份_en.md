You can view the list of backup files in Cloud Database (SQLServer) console, and download these files through private network and public network. The database can be restored to other instances (e.g. a self-built instance) by using downloaded backup files.
Use the following steps:
1.	Enter the Backup Management page in Instance Management, to view the list of backup files. Click "Download" to enter the download page
