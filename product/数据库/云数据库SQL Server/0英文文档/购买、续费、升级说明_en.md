## Upgrade Fee
Upgrade fee=(price of target specification-price of original specification) x remaining usage period
> Note: 1. You can only upgrade an instance to a higher specification. Downgrade is not supported. 2. You cannot cancel the upgrade process once it has started.

## Renewal Fee
Renewal fee=monthly price of instance x renewal period　(month) + (monthly price of instance/30 x renewal period　(day))
> Note: The renewal fee for a period less than a month is calculated based on monthly price and the number of days to renew. For example, an instance priced at 60 CNY per month expires on April 5. Suppose you want to renew the instance to May 20, then the expiration date will be adjust to the 20th day of each month, and the renewal fee is 90 CNY (60+60÷30×15).
