## With License
Tencent Cloud provides Cloud Database "**With License**", whose price covers SQL Server software license, underlying hardware resources and Tencent Cloud CDB management features. This means you don't need to buy Microsoft SQL Server license additionally.

Using Cloud Database with license, you can pay the fees based on instance specifications and usage period length without considering hardware cost and license fees, turning expensive fixed cost into low variable cost to greatly save IT cost.

**Note:**
-  Purchasing Tencent's CDB for SQL Server doesn't mean you have purchased Microsoft SQL Server license for a long-term use. Therefore, you should not use Tencent's Cloud Database license at unauthorized location and unauthorized time. For details of the requirements, please see "[Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Provider Use Rights](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/userights/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=2)".
-  The basic price for Tencent CDB for SQL Server does not cover Microsoft and Tencent manufacture services.
