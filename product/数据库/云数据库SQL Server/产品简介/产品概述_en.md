## About SQL Server
SQL Server is a relational database developed by Microsoft that features high scalability and performance as well as the capabilities to query, search, synchronize, report and analyze the data. So far, multiple versions of SQL Server have been released, with each version having its unique features.

Cloud Database now supports **SQL Server 2008 R2 sp3 and 2012 sp3**, which allow the use of custom applications developed with Microsoft .NET and Visual Studio. With many new features and key improvements in the use of data in service-oriented architecture (SOA) and business processes based on Microsoft BizTalk Server, they have become the most powerful and comprehensive ever SQL Server versions. You can easily set up, operate, and extend SQL Server deployments on the cloud to respond to the rapid changes in your business needs with ease.
