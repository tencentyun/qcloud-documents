## 1. Cloud-based Business System

## 2. Remote (Cloud) Disaster Recovery of Data
Today, electronic data has become the core assets of enterprises, and any data loss caused by act of God or human factors can bring irreparable loss to the enterprises. However, building remote data centers independently to achieve remote disaster recovery of data has a very low input-output ratio. Therefore, Cloud Database may be a good choice as a remote disaster recovery solution.
With such networks as Direct Connect and VPN as well as database synchronization tools, enterprises can synchronize the databases at self-built data centers and other cloud vendors to the remote database instances in real time. Even if the data at self-built data centers is lost completely, the data stored in the Tencent Cloud Database remains intact.

Cloud Database allows enterprises to rapidly deploy their mobile office platforms such as OA/ERP/Sales Management, with data stored in Tencent Cloud's secure subnets, providing multiple security protections and ensuring a high reliability. 

## 4. Data Warehouse & Data Analysis Platform
Through the business intelligence and IT dashboard native to SQLServer as well as the collaboration scheme with SharePoint, you can build cloud-based data warehouse and data analysis platform.

## 5. Business Resilience
Self-built data center is not a cost-effective solution to business peak during business promotion and large-scale campaigns. You can build elastic data centers at cloud data center with cloud elastic expansion capability to achieve scale-up at any time to adapt to the changing business needs. In combination with CVM and CDB for SQLServer, the elastic data centers can help you improve business resilience.
