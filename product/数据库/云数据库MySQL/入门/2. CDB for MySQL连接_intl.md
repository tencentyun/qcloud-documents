There are two methods to connect to CDB:
- Public network access: You can log in to phpMyAdmin through the login entry on the console with a public network account, and perform operations on the database (the public network address is disabled by default). Refer to [CDB for MySQL Database Management](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/236/3131) for subsequent operations or use a connection tool from a third party;
- In the other method, with an automatically assigned private network address, you can access the database by using the CVM in the same availability zone. The latency is relatively low because a high-speed private network is employed in this method.
