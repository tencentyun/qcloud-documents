Slow query indicates that a SQL query statement takes more than defined time to execute, and the corresponding statement refers to "slow query statement". Slow query analysis indicates the process during which a database administrator (DBA) analyzes the slow query statement and finds the reasons for the slow query.

You can log in to [Cloud Database Console][1], and click "Management" - "Operation log" to view the slow query log. In addition, you can view, download and read database logs on the command line interface (CLI) or through the Cloud Database API.
