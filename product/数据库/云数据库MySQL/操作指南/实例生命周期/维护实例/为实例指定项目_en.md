You can assign instances to different projects for management by using Tencent Cloud database MySQL.

You should note the following:
- Read-only instances and disaster recovery instances are associated with master instance, they need to be in the same project with the master instance.
- Assigning and moving database instances among projects will not affect the external services they provide.
- Users need to specify projects to which the new instances belong when purchasing them. The default project is "Default Project".
- You can use "Assign to Project" function to re-assign instances to other projects.
