**Backup Storage**
It is used to persistently store database data, logs or other underlying storage resources of backups.
**Read/Write Separation**
It allows primary database (master) to perform transactional operations like addition, modification and deletion (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and allows slave's read-only instance (Read only Instance) to perform SELECT query operation.

**High Reliability**
It is often used to describe that a system is specifically designed to reduce downtime, so as to maintain high availability of its service.
**Relational Database**
It is a database that is connected and organized based on relational data structure. For a relational database model, the complex data structure is simplified into a binary relation (a two-dimensional table). In a relational database, almost all data operations are performed on one or more relational tables. You can manage the database by sorting, merging, connecting or selecting these related tables. Common relational databases include: Oracle database, MySQL database, MariaDB database, SQL server database, Access database, DB2, PostgreSQL, Informix, Sybase, etc..
**SSD Disk**
Solid State Drive disk (SSD disk) is a disk made of an array of solid-state electronic memory chips, and is comprised of a control unit and a memory unit (FLASH chip and DRAM chip). The specification, definition, feature and usage of the SSD disk interface are exactly the same as those of HDD disk interface. The product shape and size of SSD disk are also identical to those of HDD disk. SSD disk is widely used in many fields, including military, vehicle, industrial control, video monitoring, network monitoring, network terminal, electric power, healthcare, aviation, and navigation equipment.

**Logical Backup**
It is a process during which data is extracted from database and stored in a binary file through SQL language. Logical backup allows you to use software technology to export data from database and write it into an output file. The format of this file is generally different from that of a file from the original database. This file is only an image of the data content in the original database. Therefore, the logical backup file can only be used for logical recovery of database (data import), instead of physical recovery according to the original storage characteristics of database. Logical backup is generally used for incremental backup of the data changed after the last backup.
**Cold Backup**
It is a backup method used when the system is shut down or under maintenance. In this case, the backup data is exactly the same as the data in the system.

**QPS**
Queries per second (QPS) is a criteria for measuring the amount of traffic handled by a particular query server within a specified period of time. 
**Hot Backup**
It is a backup method when the system is running normally. In this case, since the data in the system is updated in real time, a lag may occur between the backup dada and the real data of the system.
**Data Replication**
Data is copied from Master to Slave by using one of the following replication methods: strongsync replication, semisync replication and async replication.
**Database Storage**
It is used to persistently store database data, logs, and other underlying storage resources.
**Database Admin**
Database Admin (DBA) is responsible for database management. DBA uses specialized software to store and organize data. The functions of this role include capacity planning, installation, configuration, database design, migration, performance monitoring, security, troubleshooting, backup and data recovery.
**Number of Database Connections**
The number of sessions of the client connected to the database instance.
**Database Migration**
As business changes, database also needs to be migrated from one environment to another along with application businesses, such as from a local IDC to a cloud, or from a cloud to another.
**Database Instance**
Database instance is a standalone database environment running on the cloud. It is the basic data block used in the building of CDB. A database instance can contain multiple databases created by database users and can be accessed using the same client tools and applications as a standalone database instance.
**Database Engine**
Database engine is the core service for storing, processing and protecting data. Database engine allows you to control access permission and process transactions quickly to meet the requirements of most of the applications for processing massive data in the enterprise. Database engine is supported for each database instance.

**Physical Backup**
It is a backup process in which the operating system files that actually make up the database are copied from one place to another, usually from a disk to a tape. Physical backup is divided into cold backup and hot backup.
