## Postpaid
For the benefit of users, Tencent Cloud Redis supports tiered prices in postpaid mode. The longer the usage duration, the lower the cost.

Depending on the use time, the prices of the postpaid mode are divided into three steps:
Tier 1 (0 to 4 days): price per hour = monthly price`/30/24*2`.
Tier 2 (4 to 15 days): price per hour = monthly price`/30/24*1.5`.
Tier 3 (more than 15 days): price per hour = monthly price`/30/24`.

For instances with capacities expanded, the price is recalculated starting from Tier 1.
