### How do I choose a Redis specification? 
 You can choose a Redis specification based on capacity and performance. Capacity is determined by your data storage requirements. For more information on how to identify the right performance, see [Product Performance](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/17952).

 ### What are the performance metrics of Redis? 
 Redis is mainly divided into the cluster version and the single-node version. The single-node version provides a performance of 80,000-120,000 QPS. If you need the ability to handle over 100,000 QPS, select the cluster version. For specific performance metrics and test methods, see [Product Performance](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/17952).

 ### What Redis versions are supported? 
 Redis 2.8, Redis 3.2 and Redis 4.0 are supported. For more information, see [Redis Community](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/17953) and [Tencent Cloud CKV](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/17954).

 ### In which regions can Redis be deployed? 
 As part of the infrastructure, Redis can be deployed in all the regions where CVMs are deployed.
