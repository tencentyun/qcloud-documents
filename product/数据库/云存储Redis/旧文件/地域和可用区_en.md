Tencent Cloud currently offers a number of available regions: **North China (Beijing), East China (Shanghai), South China (Guangzhou), Hong Kong, North America, Singapore, Shanghai Finance Zone, and Shenzhen Finance Zone**.
**Notes:**
1. Cloud products in the same region communicate with each other through private network.
2. Cloud products in different regions cannot communicate with each other through private network.
3. When purchasing cloud services, you're recommended to choose the region that is closest to your customer to minimize access latency and improve download speed.
