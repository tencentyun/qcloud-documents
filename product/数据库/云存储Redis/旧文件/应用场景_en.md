Cloud Redis Store (CRS) provides high-availability, high-reliability key-value database service that can be applied to the caching scenarios where Redis protocol is used. It can also be used as the finally implemented NoSQL database. CRS is available in standalone and cluster specifications depending on the needs of different scenarios.

### Standalone
Standalone instances have an excellent compatibility with Redis open-source protocol and are suitable for the scenarios where the requirement for protocol compatibility is high and where Value is larger (greater than 10 MB, such as the user ranking across all regions and servers in a game).

### Cluster Instance
Cluster instances provide distributed highly elastic Redis storage services that are suitable for the scenarios that have a demanding requirement for the performance and capacity.
