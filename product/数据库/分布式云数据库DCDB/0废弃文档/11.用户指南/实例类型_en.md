Currently, the following instance types are supported for TDSQL:


-	**Master instance**: (Finance-level) This instance can be purchased directly by CDB for TDSQL. It has all the features of cloud database.


-	**Disaster recovery instance**: This instance is deployed remotely (different data centers) with the data synchronized with master instance in real time, and is usually used for database disaster recovery. It only has monitoring and backup features.


-	**Temporary instance**: This instance is generated by rollback to verify the data after rollback operation. You can switch the verified temporary instance to the master instance by the feature of switching to master instance.



-	**Logic instance**: It is an instance of DCDB for TDSQL with logic completeness, and is composed of many physical multiparts.


-	**Physical multipart**: It is a physically-independent database used to split the logic instances into different database instances evenly through horizontal split.
