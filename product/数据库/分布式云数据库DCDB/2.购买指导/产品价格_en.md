>DCDB is estimated to be sold at a price based on your needs (that is, separate prices for memory and disk) starting from April 2017. A new pricing policy is implemented, and details are shown below.

## Instance Price Calculation
Prepaid billing method is supported for Tencent Cloud DCDB. The billing solution is as follows:

Total price of instance=Price of shard\* Number of shards\* Time\* Discount rate=(Memory size of shard\* Unit price + Disk size of shard * Unit price)\* Number\* Time\* Discount rate

## Backup Space

Storage space for backups and logs ("backup space" in short): 50% of the instance capacity is provided free of charge. As a discount, the capacity beyond this free portion became free of charge starting from December 31, 2015. The end date of this discount is to be determined.

>The backup space mainly stores critical logs and backup files during the running of DCDB. The logs include failed transaction logs (Binlog), error logs, slow logs, etc.

## Bandwidth/Traffic Fee

Internet Traffic: Only Internet traffic generated by instances when they send data to clients incurs traffic fee. As a discount, the Internet traffic of DCDB became free of charge. The end time of the discount is to be determined.
