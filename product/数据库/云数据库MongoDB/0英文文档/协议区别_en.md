### MongoDB and DynamoDB
MongoDB is a high-performance, non-relational, schema-free, document and key-value database, which supports dynamic queries and full indexing. MongoDB has become the most widely used NoSQL database with its high performance and ease of deployment, use and data storage.
Its main features are as follows:
1. Set storage. A set can store an unlimited number of documents.
2. Schema-free. It uses schemaless storage mode.
3. Full index is supported. You can create indexes on any attributes, including the internal objects. In addition, MongoDB provides the ability to create geospatial-based indexes.
4. Rich query operations. MongoDB supports rich query operations and expressions
5. Powerful aggregation tools. It provides powerful aggregation functions such as count, group.
6. Replication and data recovery are supported. MongoDB supports master-slave replication mechanism to realize data backup, failure recovery, read expansion and other functions.


DynamoDB, a fully hosted NoSQL database service from Amazon, delivers fast, predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is a highly scalable, table-based NoSQL database and supports document and key-value storage models.
Its main features are as follows:
1. The scalable, fully distributed and non-shared architecture can provide a horizontal expansion capability to seamlessly extend a table to multiple servers.
2. Fast and predictable performance: The average latency of AWS DynamoDB server is usually milliseconds.
3. Easy to manage. As a fully hosted service, AWS DynamoDB can relieve concerns on running a reliable distributed database cluster.
4. Built-in fault tolerance. AWS DynamoDB has the inherent fault tolerance capability allowing automatic and synchronous replication of your data to multiple availability zones in a Region.
5. Flexibility: AWS DynamoDB does not have a fixed schema.
6. Strong consistency and atomic counter: It supports the strong consistency of read operations to ensure that you get the latest data. The service supports atomic counter.

Based on the existing NoSQL module framework, Tencent Cloud's database team carries out protocol-compatible development for AWS DynamoDB database service. DynamoDB is compatible with most basic protocols, and meets the normal database access needs. Also, it supports instance-level backup and rollback, and automatic disaster recovery mechanism to ensure high reliability and availability of the service.
What it can do for you
1. If you are a DynamoDB development enthusiast, you can use Tencent Cloud's database services to meet your development needs
2. If you are an overseas customer and need to deploy DynamoDB services in China for your projects developed using the DynamoDB protocol, you can access Tencent cloud databases via DynamoDB protocol without too many code modifications.
