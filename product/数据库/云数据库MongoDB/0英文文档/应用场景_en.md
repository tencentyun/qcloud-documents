Cloud Database MongoDB is a general-purpose database with  high stability, performance and scalability, which can be applied to most scenarios. Here are several typical examples:
### Game Industry
The requirements for games change rapidly, MongoDB is especially suitable for game backend databases. It does not have a fixed schema, which saves you the effort to change table structures and significantly shortens version iteration cycle. MongoDB can be used as a cache server to logically allocate hot data; its performance is comparable to other common cache servers while providing more query methods.

### Mobile Industry
All mobile APPs have business demand for location queries. Cloud Database MongoDB supports two-dimensional spatial indexing, which makes it easy to query geo-location relationships and retrieve user geographic location data, thus achieving the implantation of geo-based map applications.


### IOT Industry
In the field of IOT (Internet of Things), terminal devices (such as medical equipment and transport vehicle GPS) may easily and continuously generate TBs of data. The sharding technology used in Cloud Database MongoDB can be used to build a distributed database cluster, achieving storage without capacity limit, while facilitating online capacity expansion.
