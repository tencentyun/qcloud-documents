### Renaming a Database Instance
You can rename a database instance in the console. When renaming a database, please keep the following in mind:

- Modification to the database instance name will not change the private IP of database or affect the database connection.
- An instance cannot be renamed with an existing database instance.
- After the database instance is renamed, the project and network to which the instance belongs to remain unchanged.
- An instance with a status such as "Upgrading" or "Initializing" cannot be renamed.
