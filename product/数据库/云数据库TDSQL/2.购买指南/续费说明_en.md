3. Go to "User Center" -> "Renewal Management" -> "Cloud Database MariaDB (TDSQL)" and find the items awaiting renewal. Select instance, and configure Auto Renew or no renewal upon expiration.

2 Renewal Fee

Renewal fee=Monthly price of instance x Renewal period (month) + (Monthly price of instance/30 x Renewal period (day))

Note: The renewal fee for a period less than a month is calculated based on monthly price and the number of days to renew. For example, an instance with a monthly price of 60 CNY expires on April 5th. Suppose you want to renew the instance to May 20th, then the expiration date is adjusted to the 20th day of each month, and the renewal fee is 90 CNY (60+60รท30ร15).
