Databases provide the following instance types:

-	**Master instance**: This instance can be purchased directly. It has all the features of a database.

-   **Master instance (exclusive) [not supported yet]**: This is a database instance you apply for within an exclusive cluster in the Exclusive Database Cluster mode. It has all the features of a database.

-	**Disaster recovery instance [not supported yet]**: This instance is deployed remotely (different availability zones) with the data synchronized with the master instance in real time (asynchronously), and is usually used for database disaster recovery. It only has some features of a database.

-	**Temporary instance [not supported yet]**: It is a temporary instance generated by rollback for data verification after rollback. You can switch the verified temporary instance to the master instance using the Switch to Master Instance feature.

-	**Read-only instance [not supported yet]**: An instance that only allows read access is called a read-only instance. A read-only instance cannot exist alone, and must belong to a master instance. A read-only instance only acquires data through synchronization with the master instance, and is invisible in the instance list.
