## Performance Monitoring
PostgreSQL provides various performance monitoring metrics to make it easy for users to view and obtain the operation information of instances. You can check the information in **Instance Management** -> **System Monitoring** in the PostgreSQL console.

## `pg_stat_statements`
You can view detailed performance metrics of pg from the [`pg_stat_statements`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/pgstatstatements.html) view.

## Available Monitoring Metrics
| Metric Name | Metric API | Description | Unit |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| CPU utilization | cpu | CPU utilization of the instance. This may go beyond 100% due to flexible CPU limitation strategies when idle | % |
| Occupied storage | storage | Disk storage space occupied by the instance | GB |
| Disk IOPS | iops | IOPS (number of requests per second) of the instance | requests per second |
| Input traffic | in_flow | Input traffic generated by data read/write operations for the instance | KB per second |
| Output traffic | out_flow | Output traffic generated by data read/write operations for the instance | KB per second |
| Number of connections | connections | Historical trend for the number of active connections of the instance | - |
| Number of requests | read_write_calls | Total number of read/write requests (addition, deletion, modification and query) per minute | requests per minute |
| Number of read requests | read_calls | Total number of read requests per minute | requests per minute |
| Number of write requests | write_calls | Total number of write requests per minute | requests per minute |
| Number of other requests | other_calls | Total number of requests other than read/write requests (such as Drop), accumulated by the minute | requests per minute |
| Cache hit rate | hit_percent | Data cache hit rate | % |
| Average execution latency | sql_runtime_avg | The average execution time of all SQL requests (SQLs in transactions not included). | ms |
| TOP 10 longest execution latencies | sql_runtime_avg | Average execution latency of top 10 longest SQL requests | ms |
| TOP 10 shortest execution latencies | sql_runtime_min | Average execution latency of top 10 shortest SQL requests | ms |
| Number of remaining XID | remain_xid | Number of remaining Transaction IDs. There are a maximum of 2^32 Transaction Ids. It is recommended to execute "vacuum full" manually if the number falls below 1,000,000. | - |
| Synchronization difference between master/slave XLOG | xlog_diff | (Sample is taken every minute) The synchronization difference between the master XLOG and the slave XLOG. This represents synchronization delay, and lower is better. | byte |
