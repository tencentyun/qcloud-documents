## Notes
**1. PostgreSQL provides accounts with permissions including creating/modifying databases and accounts. But it does not support super admin accounts.**


**2. It is recommended that you use a public network address for routine maintenance, rather than connecting business servers.**


**3. The network to which the instance created belongs cannot be modified.**
