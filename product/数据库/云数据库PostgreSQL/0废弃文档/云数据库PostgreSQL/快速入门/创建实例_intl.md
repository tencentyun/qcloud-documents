## Step 1: Create New Instance
After logging in to your Tencent Cloud account, you can see the existing instances in the **Console**. Click **New** to apply for a new instance.

**Apply for New Instance** pop-up appears, where you can configure relevant settings. The increment of storage space is 10 GB.

Click **OK** to view the new instance in the instance list, with "To be initialized" status by default.

## Step 2: Initialize Instance
Select the instance you want to initialize, click **Initialize in Batch** or **Initialize**, and then enter the admin user name, password and supported character set to complete the initialization.

Note: The supported character set is the global instance character set, which cannot be changed once determined. (Under instances, global character set can be different from database. You can configure this when creating databases.)
