Renewal means to extend the usage period of a CDB for PostgreSQL instance. You can do this in the following ways:

1. Go to "Console" -> "Cloud Database" -> "PostgreSQL" -> "Renewal", select the instance(s) to be renewed, and click "Renew" or "Batch Renew".
2. Go to "User Center" -> "Renewal Management" -> "Cloud Database (PostgreSQL)", select the instance(s) to be renewed, and click "Renew" or "Batch Renew", as shown below:

3. Go to "User Center" -> "Renewal Management" -> "Cloud Database (PostgreSQL)" and find the items awaiting renewal. Select instance, and configure Auto Renew or no renewal upon expiration.

2 Renewal Fee

Renewal fee=monthly price of instance x renewal period　(month) + (monthly price of instance/30 x renewal period　(day))

Note: The renewal fee for a period less than a month is calculated based on monthly price and the number of days to renew. For example, an instance with a monthly price of 60 CNY expires on April 5th. Suppose you want to renew the instance to May 20th, then the expiration date will be adjusted to the 20th day of each month, and the renewal fee is 90 CNY (60+60÷30×15).
