## 1. Enterprise Database
Applications such as ERP, trading system and financial system need to handle sensitive data such as fund and customer information. Therefore, they cannot lose any data and require complex business logics. With PostgreSQL as the underlying storage system, you can achieve high availability with data consistency and implement complex business logics using simple programming language.

## 2. Applications with LBS
Large games, O2O and other applications need to support such capabilities as world map, nearby stores and distance between two points, etc. PostGIS provides additional support for geographic objects, allowing you to run location queries with SQL without the need of complex programming languages, so that you can simplify your business logics, easily implement LBS, and increase the user stickiness.

## 3. Data Warehouse and Big Data
PostgreSQL supports various types of data and provides powerful computing capacity, enabling you to build data warehouse or big data analysis platform in a more convenient way, so as to boost operational efficiency.

## 4. Build Website or App
With powerful features provided by high-performance PostgreSQL, you can efficiently improve website performance and reduce development difficulty.
