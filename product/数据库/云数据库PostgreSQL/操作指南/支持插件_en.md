Currently, CDB for PostgreSQL supports the following plug-ins. Super admin permission is needed for some plug-ins. We are developing quick support for this. If you want to use any of such plug-ins before the availability of the feature, please submit a ticket indicating the "instance ID, region, and the name of the plug-in to be enabled" so that our service personnel can enable the plug-in for you.
