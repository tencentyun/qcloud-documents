Currently, the cloud database provides the following instance types:

-	**Master instance**: This instance can be purchased directly. It has all the features of cloud database.

-   **Master instance (dedicated) (currently not supported)**: This is the database instance you apply for within the dedicated cluster in Dedicated Database Cluster mode. It has all the features of cloud database.

-	**Disaster recovery instance (currently not supported)**: This instance is deployed remotely (different availability zones) with real-time (async) synchronized data as the master instance, and is usually used for database disaster recovery. It only has partial cloud database features.

-	**Temporary instance (currently not supported)**: This is a temporary instance generated by rollback, and is used for verifying data after rollback. You can switch the verified temporary instance into master instance.

-	**Read-only instance (currently not supported)**: You can only read data from such instance. A read-only instance cannot exist alone, and must belong to a master instance. A read-only instance only acquires data through synchronization with the master instance, and is invisible in the instance list.
