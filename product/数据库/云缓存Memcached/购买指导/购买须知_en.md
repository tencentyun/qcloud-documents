## 1. Before purchase
Before purchasing Cloud Memcached, you need to know its billing method and rules. This service is charged based on occupied space (used space + reserved buffer space). Space less than 1 GB will be counted as 1 GB. For more information, please see [Cloud Memcached Type and Price](/doc/product/241/类型及价格)


## 2. Purchase a new table
1. Log in to Tencent Cloud homepage cloud.tencent.com.

2. In Product Service module, select Cloud Memcached, and click "Buy Now" to proceed with the purchase.

>Note: If you need to create a large number of tables, and the total space of initial tables is larger than 100 GB or the initial space of a table is larger than 20 GB, you can [submit a ticket](http://console.cloud.tencent.com/ticket). If the access volume exceeds 10,000 visits per second for 1 GB storage space, after a new table is created, you can submit a [ticket](/doc/product/282/联系我们#4-开发者运维需求申请) to apply for interface/port expansion.
