1. Game Data
In single-region and single-server game scenarios, Tencent Cloud Memcached can be used as a cache layer to store non-character data, such as Ranklist. The high-performance Cloud Memcached can satisfy players' need to access data quickly and eliminate your need to design complex backend system to deal with high concurrency.

2. Site Data Caching
Dynamic webpages with high visits in a website can lead to a high load on database. Because most database requests are read operations, you can use Cloud Memcached to cache static web page data to reduce database load and improve the loading speed of webpages users are visiting.

3. Social Applications
In social applications, a large amount of user and friend data need to be referenced. Cross-table or cross-library operations directly performed on databases for all the features can cause a huge efficiency loss and system load. You can cache these data using Cloud Memcached to significantly improve access speed.

4. E-commerce Data Caching
On e-commerce websites, commodity categorization data, data in commodity search result list as well as commodity and merchant data visible to visitors has a very high access count and does not change frequently. In such a scenario, you can cache the data using Cloud Memcached to allow fast data read/write and improve access speed.
