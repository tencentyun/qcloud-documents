1)	Automated Deployment
It supports the on-demand configuration for the number of nodes and the visual one-click deployment for computing nodes and storage nodes. You don't need to pay attention to the internal details, which eliminates the needs for your deployment and saves you 60% of the development time, so you can put more efforts into the business operation.

2)	Service Availability	
In order to provide the best data persistence and availability, Tencent Cloud HBase automatically detects and replaces any failure nodes in your data cluster. The replaced nodes can be used immediately, which restores data query for you as soon as possible and ensure the normal operation of cluster, so you do not need to take any action as the service will be automatically switched without affecting your business.

3)	Data Reliability
The underlying distributed file system HDFS can provide redundant storage of multiple data (three backups by default) to ensure the data reliability. You do not have to worry about that data can be lost.

4)	Monitoring
The visual monitoring of cluster status, node traffic, read/write requests, storage capacity and other key data indexes makes you fully master the operating state and avoid risks in advance.

5)	Operation and Maintenance
Users do not need to care about fault handling, version upgrade, node addition and deletion in the running course of HBase, as the Cloud Database OPS team will take care of these tasks. You only need to pay attention to the reading and writing of your business data.
