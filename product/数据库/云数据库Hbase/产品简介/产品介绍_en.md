# About Tencent Cloud Database HBase
Cloud Database HBase (Cloud HBase Service) is a high-performance, scalable, column-oriented distributed storage system developed by Tencent Cloud based on the world's popular HBase, which is fully compatible with the HBase protocols, and suitable for the scenarios with big writing throughput, massive data storage as well as the distributed computing. It provides you with the stable and rich cluster management, as well as the flexible and scalable database services.

Tencent Cloud Database HBase has the following key features:
1) Automated deployment supports the on-demand configuration for the number of nodes and the visual one-click deployment of computing and storage nodes. You don't need to pay attention to the internal details, which eliminates the need for your deployment.
2) Cluster management and monitoring, and visualized states of the nodes under the monitoring cluster. You can perform node operations such as adding, deleting, starting, disabling and viewing. The graphical trends of data index make monitoring more three-dimensional.
3) Cluster scalability, and the task scheduling cluster issuing operation and maintenance instructions to all the nodes of HBase cluster, hdfs cluster, and yarn cluster to achieve the automation of operation and maintenance, which achieve the rapid capacity expansion of nodes.
4) High-availability services and the storage layer HDFS high-availability HA. Once the single point fails, it can be quickly switched to the slave node, thereby achieving the uninterrupted services provided externally.
