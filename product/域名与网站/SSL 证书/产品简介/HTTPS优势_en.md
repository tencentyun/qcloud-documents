When an SSL certificate is installed on your website, the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) will change to HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer) for secure data transfer.

Advantages of websites applying HTTPS:

### 1. Anti-traffic hijacking
Full HTTPS is a solution to eradicate traffic hijacking by ISPs and intermediaries, which can prevent advertisements inserted in webpages, and protect user privacy.

### 2. Improving Search Rankings
HTTPS can help improve search rankings, credibility and brand image of websites.

### 3. Avoiding Phishing Webites
The green icon on HTTPS address bar helps users identify phishing websites, which protects the interests of users and businesses, and enhances users' trust in the websites.
