If you do not pass the verification when you choose to manually verify the DNS, you can diagnose the domain name resolution problem through self-diagnosis:

### 1. Check Whether the Domain Name Status is Normal
Make sure the domain name can be properly resolved. For domain names without identity verifications, domain names just purchased, etc., the resolution may fail.

### 2. Check the DNS Server
Make sure you have added the resolution at the correct DNS service provider. For example, if DNS server is a Wanwang server, it will not work to add TXT resolution in Tencent Cloud DNS.

### 3. Check Resolution Records
With the domain name properly resolved and the resolution added in the correct DNS service provider, if you still do not pass the verification, the host name, record value and so on may be mistakenly entered. If the TXT records are added completely and correctly, please wait for one hour.

If you still do not pass the verification one hour later, you can submit a ticket to ask Tencent Cloud engineers for assistance.
