Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a security protocol designed to ensure security and data integrity for Internet communications. Based on the SSL protocol, an SSL certificate can be installed on the server to achieve encrypted data transfer.

Certificate authorities (CAs) are third-party authorities that verify the validity of public keys. They are responsible for specifying policies and procedures to verify users' identities, sign SSL certificates, and ensure the identity of a certificate holder and ownership of a public key. CAs issue SSL certificates for each user using the public key. A SSL certificate is used to certify that individuals/businesses listed in the certificate lawfully own the public key listed in the certificate. Digital signatures from CAs can prevent certificates from being forged and tampered.

An SSL certificate actually represents the verification of the public key from an CA, which contains digital certificate-signing authority information, user information of the public key, the public key, authority signature, and expiration date.
