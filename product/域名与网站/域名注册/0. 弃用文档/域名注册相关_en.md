### Domain Name Registration
You can acquire a domain name by paying for a one-year or multiple-year usage right for it, which is called domain name registration. According to international convention, domain name registration follows the rule of "first to apply, first to register". A domain name must be unique and can only correspond to one server. Once a domain name is registered, it belongs to the person who registered it within the registration period unless the person revokes or transfers the ownership. Therefore, it is recommended to register your domain name as soon as possible.

### How to Select a Suitable Domain Name?
1. It is recommended to use a personalized domain name which is simple to memorize (related to your company name, brand or product. You can also select a domain name based on the nature or functionality of your website or your customer base).
2. You can register multiple suffixes for the same domain name to protect your brand and make it easier for users to find your website.
3. It is suggested that you select a usage period of more than 2 years when purchasing a domain name. Domain name is an annual rental product. Registering a domain name for multiple years can help you reduce the risk of losing it when domain name prices rise or when you forget to renew your domain name in time.

### What if a Domain Name is Already Registered?
Each domain name is "unique". Once a domain name is registered by someone, other people can no longer register it. You can try to search for domain names with different suffixes. For example, if you want to register "abc.com" which is already taken, you can try going for "abc.net" or "abc.cn". They have no differences when being used.
If you want to acquire a domain name registered by someone else, you can query its owner by entering the domain name in the whois query tool and contact the owner to see whether he/she is willing to transfer it to you.
You can also ask a domain name intermediary or a similar agency to purchase a domain name.

### What Should I do after Registering my Domain Name?
**1. Identity Verification**
Identity verification must be completed in 5 work days after a domain name is registered, or it will be put into "serverhold" status and cannot be used. Please see [Identity Verification](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/6707)>>
**2. Renew Domain Name in Time**
A domain name is only valid for a certain amount of time. Make sure to renew it before expiration to avoid service interruption. You can renew your domain name once it goes into Renewal period or Redemption period, but both of these phases will affect domain name resolution. For more information, please see [FAQ on Renewal Period and Redemption Period](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/3705).
**3. Change Information**
Should your registration information changes, be sure to [Modify Domain Name Registration Information](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/3648) in time.

### What if my Domain Name is in Dispute?
Any organization or individual can file a complaint to the dispute settlement body if they believe that a domain name registered by someone else is in conflict with their lawful rights and interests.
If you believe that the domain name you registered is involved in dispute, contact the domain name dispute settlement bodies verified by CNNIC to settle the dispute. For, now, there are two such bodies: The Domain Name Dispute Resolution Center of China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, and Hong Kong International Arbitration Center.

### Can I Ask for Refund after Registering my Domain Name?
Domain names are instant products and cannot be modified. Refund is also not available once a domain name is registered. For example, if you want to register a domain name "xiaochengxu", but you enter a wrong name "xiaochenxu" by accident. At this time, you can only register another domain name which is correct.

### Can I Delete a Registered Domain Name?
No. If you don't need the domain name, you just do not renew it until it is expires.
If you don't want to open your website using this domain name, you can suspend or delete the resolution record from the domain name console.
