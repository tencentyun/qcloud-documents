### Introduction to Domain Name
There are tens of millions of servers on the Internet, each server is assigned an IP address to be distinguished from one another. However, an IP address doesn't have any actual meaning to it which makes it hard to be remembered, and this is why a Domain Name comes into play.
A domain name mainly consists of English letters, Arabic numerals, "-", ".", etc.. Domain name is designed to be convenient for memorizing and easy to use when communicating with a group of server addresses (such as website, email and FTP).
A domain name and an IP correspond to each other. There are specialized DNS (domain name servers) on the Internet which are used to translate between domain names and IPs. When you enter a domain name in your browser, DNS will translate the domain name into an IP. Then the corresponding server will be found and open.
If you want establish a server to publish information on the Internet, a domain name needs to be registered, which is a basic for establishing services on the Internet. Since the registration of domain name follows the rule of "first to apply, first to register" and every registered domain name is unique in the China Domain Name Library, it is recommended to register your domain name as soon as possible.

### Types of Domain Name
For now, there are mainly two types of domain names: top-level domain name and ordinary domain name.

A top-level domain name refers to a domain name which contains only 3 segments of strings after the identifier "http://". For example: `http://www.qq.com`, `http://cloud.tencent.com`. Segments are separated by dots. "www" stands for "World Wide Web", "qcloud" refers to Tencent Cloud, and "com" means a commercial company.
Top-level domain names are divided into international ones and domestic ones:
* International top-level domain names are also called international domain names. These are the earliest and most widely-used domain names. For example, ".com" (for companies and enterprises), ".net" (for network services), ".org" (for non-profit organizations).
* Domestic top-level domain names are also called domestic domain names. They are assigned different suffixes according to their country/region. For example, ".cn" (China), ".us" (USA) and ".jp" (Japan).

An ordinary domain name refers to the domain name which contains 4 segments of strings after the identifier "http://", such as `http://www.qq.com.cn`, `http://cloud.tencent.com.cn`.

### Domain Name Registration
You can acquire a domain name by paying for a one-year or multiple-year usage right for it, which is called domain name registration. According to international convention, domain name registration follows the rule of "first to apply, first to register". A domain name must be unique and can only correspond to one server. Once a domain name is registered, it belongs to the person who registered it within the registration period unless the person revokes or transfers the ownership. Therefore, it is recommended to register your domain name as soon as possible. The domain name registration process is shown below:
