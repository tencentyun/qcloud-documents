Tencent Cloud allows you to renew your domain name automatically to avoid manual renewal. When this feature is enabled, the system will automatically renew your domain name upon expiration. The steps to configure the feature are as follows:
>Make sure your account balance is sufficient when enabling auto renewal, or renewal will fail.

**Step 1: Log in to the Console**
Open the [Tencent Cloud Official Website](https://cloud.tencent.com/) and click "Console" on the right of the top navigation bar to log in to the console home page.
