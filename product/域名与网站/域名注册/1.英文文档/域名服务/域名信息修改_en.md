When domain name information you entered upon domain name registration (such as email address or mobile phone number) needs to be changed, you need to modify the information in order to protect your domain name.

>**Note:**
>1. If the domain name is registered before July 18th, 2016 that does not need identity verification for now, or the domain name whose identity is not verified or not being verified, the domain name owner can be modified.
>2. The domain name owner owns the domain name. Should you lost your account and need to retrieve your purchased domain name, you can [Submit Ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for technical assistance. You also need to provide the following certificates:
 * Individual user: personal ID number and the scanned copy of your frontal ID card;
 * Enterprise user: scanned copy of your business license or organization code certificate.
 
>3. For more information on domain name identity verification, please see [Identity Verification FAQ](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/8580).
