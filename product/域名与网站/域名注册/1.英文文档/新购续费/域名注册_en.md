>**Notes**:
>Identify verification must be completed after registering a .com/.net/.cn/.club/.中国 domain name, or the domain name will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be accessed.
For now, domain names using ".info/.name/.club" as suffixes cannot acquire ICP license in Beijing;
Individual ".org" domain names cannot acquire ICP license in Chongqing;


### Step 1: Query Domain Name
Before registering a domain name, you need to query whether the domain name or suffix you want to register is already registered by someone else. If so, you should find out a domain name or suffix that is not registered and go to the next step.
#### 1. Open Domain Name Registration Page
Log in to [Tencent Cloud Official Website](https://cloud.tencent.com/). There are two ways to enter the domain name registration page:
- Method 1: From the top navigation bar, open "Product" -> "Domain Name Service" -> "Domain Name Registration" to go to the domain name registration page.

#### 2. Query Domain Name
In the input box of the domain name registration page, enter the domain name and suffix you want to register (for example "example.com") and click "Query" to see whether the domain name is registered before.
>If the result shows "Registered", then the domain name is registered by someone else and you need to use another domain name or suffix.
If the result shows "Add to Shopping Cart", you can register this domain name that has not been registered.
