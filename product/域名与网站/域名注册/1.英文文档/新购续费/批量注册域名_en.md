There's no limit to how many domain names can be registered for an entity (individual or enterprise). Multiple different domain names can be registered for a website. Follow these steps if you want to register more than one domain name at the same time:

>**Notes**:
>Identify verification must be completed after registering a .com/.net/.cn/.club/.中国 domain name, or the domain name will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be accessed.
For now, domain names using ".info/.name/.club" as suffixes cannot acquire ICP license in Beijing;
Individual ".org" domain names cannot acquire ICP license in Chongqing;

### Step 1: Query Batch of Domain Names
Before registering a domain name, you need to query whether the domain name you want to register is already registered by someone else. If so, you should find out a domain name or suffix that is not registered and go to the next step.
Tencent Cloud provides the batch query of domain name which allows you to query multiple domain names with only one click.
**1. Open Domain Name Registration Page**
Log in to [Tencent Cloud Official Website](https://cloud.tencent.com/). There are two ways to enter the domain name registration page:
 - From the top navigation bar, open "Product" -> "Domain Name Service" -> "Domain Name Registration" to go to the domain name registration page.

Enter the domain names you want to query in the input box and select the suffix to be queried (such as ".com"). Click "Query" to view the registration statuses of these domain names.
>You can enter up to 30 domain names for batch query, with each line containing one domain name, as shown below:
>If the result shows "Registered", then the domain name is registered by someone else and you need to use another domain name or suffix.
If the result shows "Add to Shopping Cart", you can register this domain name that has not been registered.
