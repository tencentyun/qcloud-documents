During domain name identity verification, the domain name will be put into Serverhold status, and resumed to OK status in 1-2 work days once verification is successful.

### Why did Identity Verification Fail?
The possible reasons for failed identity verification are as follows:
**1. Submitted certificate does not match with the identity of domain name owner**
Check if the certificate information you submitted completely matches with the identity of domain name owner. If not, correct the information and submit for verification again.
**2. Submitted information is unclear, incomplete or cannot be opened**
Submit the complete and clear image of the required certificate in the correct format.
**3. Verification of the submitted certificate information is failed (identity certificate does not match with the result queried by public security department API)**
Individual: If your household registration is being migrated, or ID card has expired or is invalid, you can submit your residence certificate (with household special stamp) or scanned copy of your household registration booklet.
Enterprise: If your enterprise name on business license has changed, or certificate has expired or is invalid, you can submit your enterprise certification information (with official seal of the Administration for Industry and Commerce) or other valid certificate.
**4. Submitted certificate is unqualified**
For individual domain name, you need to submit a scanned copy of ID card that matches with the identity of the domain name owner; for enterprise domain name, submit scanned copy of the business license or organization code certificate that matches with the identity of the domain name owner.
**5. Domain name information is not complete**
Complete your domain name information and submit for identity verification again.

### .com/.net/.cn/.中国 Domain Name is in Serverhold Status

Go to [Domain Name Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/domain/mydomain) and request for identity verification. Once verification is passed, the domain name will be resumed to OK status in 1-2 work days.

### Can I Change Domain Name Information if Identity Verification is Completed?
If identity verification is completed, you can go to the domain name management page and click "Edit" to modify owner information.
>**Note:**
Changing the owner for a domain name which has completed identity verification requires new owner to upload the certificate information of the new owner and verify identity again. This does not affect the current verification status, which means the resolution and access of the domain name stay functional when you change its owner.

- If domain is owned by an individual, upload scanned copy of the ID card of domain name owner.
