### What is domain name transfer code?
A domain name transfer code is generated when your domain name is transferred from original domain name registrar to another one. This code is used for transfer authorization. To acquire it, contact the original domain name registrar, who will send you this code via email immediately (in most cases) after verifying your domain name identity. After the code is acquired, you can transfer your domain name to the registrar successfully within 6 days.
>Contact your original domain name registrar to acquire the transfer code, as Tencent Cloud is not able to acquire it for you.

### What if the domain name admin email is invalid?
Contact the original registrar and change the domain name admin email to a valid one which is able to reply to verification emails in time.

### Is there a limit on the number of years for purchasing or renewing a domain name?

And the number of years for which you can renew = 10 (years) - the number of years the domain name has been. For example, if you have owned a domain name for 3 years, you can renew to use it for another 7 years at most. 
>**Note:** Certain domain names with special suffixes (such as .tm) can only be purchased by making one-off payment for 10 years, thus you do not need to renew them.

### How many years can I purchase to use a domain name at most?
According to ICANN, a domain name can be owned by a user for 10 years at most. We will charge initial registration fee in the first year, and renewal fee in the following years (2-10), which are different for domain names with different suffixes;
