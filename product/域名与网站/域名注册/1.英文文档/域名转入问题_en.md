Here are the possible reasons if your international domain name transfer did not succeed:

Contact the original domain name registrar to restore domain name status to "ACTIVE" or "OK" (or unlock the domain name).
**2. Original registrar refuses the request for transfer.** Contact the original registrar and complete the procedures for domain name transfer, then submit request for transferring domain name at Tencent Cloud.
