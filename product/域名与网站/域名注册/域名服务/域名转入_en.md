## 6. Why is Domain Name Transfer Failed?
If your international domain name transfer did not succeed, some reasons are as follows:
(1) Domain name status is not "ACTIVE" or "OK". If domain name's "STATUS" is not "ACTIVE" or "OK" when queried via the whois system, the domain will not be successfully transferred. Contact the original domain name registrar to restore domain name status to "ACTIVE" or "OK" (or unlock the domain name).
(2) Original registrar refuses the request for transfer. Contact the original registrar and complete the procedures for domain name transfer, then submit request for transferring domain name at Tencent Cloud.
(3) Domain name has expired. Contact the original registrar and renew your domain name, then submit request for transferring domain name at Tencent Cloud.
(4) Domain name admin email is invalid. Contact the original registrar and change the domain name admin email to a valid one which is able to reply to verification emails in time.
(5) Transfer confirmation email is not replied in time. After you submit an international domain name transfer application to Tencent Cloud and confirm the domain name transfer to Tencent Cloud, the original registrar will send you a confirmation email for your domain name transferring away with a time limit. Domain name transfer will not succeed if you don't reply to this email in time.
(6) The original domain name admin email is changed after transfer application is submitted. The new email does not receive the confirmation email for transfer, as the email has been sent to the original admin contact email.
(7) The transfer fails immediately if you entered an incorrect transfer code.
(8) Contact your original domain name registrar to acquire the transfer code, as Tencent Cloud is not able to acquire it for you.
