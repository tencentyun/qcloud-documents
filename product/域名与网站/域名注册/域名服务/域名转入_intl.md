## Guidance for Transferring Domain Names to Tencent Cloud

### Obtaining the domain name transfer code
Submit a domain name transfer application to the original registrar to obtain the domain name transfer code.
A transfer code (auth-code) must be obtained from the original registrar when you transfer a domain name. For foreign registrars (such as Godaddy), the transfer code can be sent to the email of the domain name owner with a click on a button on the control panel. While there is usually no such feature for registrars in China, you need to contact the registrar or the registration agency where you registered your domain name and ask for the transfer code manually, or request for domain name transfer. In this case, they can provide you with the transfer process.
If you purchase your domain name from an agency of a registrar (www.net.cn or www.west.cn), when the agency refuses to provide the transfer code, you can send a complaint to its registrar. If the registrar does not cooperate either, send your complaint to ICANN, CNNIC or other registries.
According to the regulations of domain name administration authorities (ICANN Domain Name Transfer Policy), the original registrar is not allowed to refuse or restrict users from transferring their domain names away, nor ask for any extra fee for any reason. If the original registrar does not follow the rules, the domain name owner can file a complaint by filling in and submitting the [Transfer Complaint Form](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/transfer/form).

### Reasons for domain name transfer failure
If your international domain name transfer did not succeed, some reasons are as follows:
- The domain name status is not "ACTIVE" or "OK". If the domain name's "STATUS" is not "ACTIVE" or "OK" when queried via the WHOIS system, the domain name will not be successfully transferred to Tencent Cloud. Contact the original domain name registrar to restore the domain name status to "ACTIVE" or "OK" (or unlock the domain name).
- The original registrar refuses the request for transfer. Contact the original registrar and complete the procedure for domain name transfer-out, and then submit a request for transferring domain name to Tencent Cloud at Tencent Cloud.
- The domain name has expired. Contact the original registrar and complete the domain name renewal procedure, and then submit a request for transferring domain name to Tencent Cloud at Tencent Cloud.
- The domain name admin email is invalid. Contact the original registrar and change the domain name admin email to a valid one which is able to reply to verification emails in time.
- The transfer confirmation email is not replied in time. After you submit an international domain name transfer application to Tencent Cloud and confirm the transfer, the original registrar will send you a confirmation email for your domain name transferring away with a time limit. Domain name transfer will not succeed if you don't reply to this email in time.
- The original domain name admin email is changed after the transfer application is submitted. The new email does not receive the confirmation email for transfer, as the email has been sent to the original admin contact email.
- The transfer fails immediately if you entered an incorrect transfer code.
- Contact your original domain name registrar to obtain the transfer code, as Tencent Cloud is not able to obtain it for you.
