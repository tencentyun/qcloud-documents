If your domain name has expired for more than 30 days but no more than 60 days, your domain name will be in "domain name redemption period", during which you can redeem the domain name by paying a price higher than ordinary renewal cost to keep using it. Make sure to renew your domain name in advance to keep it functional and avoid unnecessary lost.
>**Note:**
1. To redeem a domain name, you need to make a payment which is higher than normal renewal price (price for redemption is determined by the registry, and Tencent Cloud only collects the payment for the registry).
2. Domain name resolution is suspended during redemption period. Once redeemed, domain name DNS will be resumed within 72 hours. However, you need to reconfigure the resolution records for the domain name. Once this is done, domain name will be resumed in 24-72 hours.

Detailed steps for domain name redemption are as follows:
#### Step 1:
Enter the [Tencent Cloud Official Website](https://cloud.tencent.com/) and click "Console" on the right of the top navigation bar to log in to the Tencent Cloud console home page.
From the **Cloud Products in Use** bar, click "Domain Name Management" to go to the domain name management page and view the list of information of all domain names you have purchased.
