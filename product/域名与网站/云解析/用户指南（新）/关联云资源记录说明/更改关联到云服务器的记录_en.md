You can modify the public network/private network CVM of a sub-domain name, including the host name. Suppose you already added a sub-domain name (internal.qcloud-example.com) which is associated with the CVM private network in Cloud DNS, and you want to modify the associated CVM.

### From the record management page, find the corresponding record associated and click **Modify** in its operation bar.

### Select the resource to be modified.
From the pop-up dialog box, internal currently points towards two CVMs, "testcvm" and "testcvm_qswu". Click **OK** to finish the operation.
