## Overview
Tencent Cloud DNS allows to assign domain names to different projects for management.
## Operation Instructions
### Add Domain Name
When adding domain name in the **All Domain Names** tab, you need to choose a project to assign the domain name.

### Move Domain Name
For domain names that are already assigned to projects, you can move them to other projects (for example, project 123) by selecting **Batch Operation** -> **Assign to Project** (multiple domain names can be moved at the same time).

### Project Permission

The collaborator of project 123 can choose first-level domain names in project 123 and perform resolution operations to them, while this collaborator has no permission to perform such operations to first-level domain names in other projects.
