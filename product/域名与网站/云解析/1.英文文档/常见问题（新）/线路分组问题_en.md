### Can line grouping be used in the free edition?
Line grouping is only available in the paid DNS packages. Please upgrade your DNS package if this feature is needed.

Only the domain names configured with a line group can be copied, and you can only copy the line group of a lower-level domain name to a higher-level domain name.

Each line can only be added to one line group. To add a line to a new group, modify the old group.

A line group cannot have the same name as the system default line or a custom line.
