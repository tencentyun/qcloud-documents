This document describes common DNS hijacking types and how Webmasters and Internet users deal with them.
There are two service roles in a DNS system: recursive DNS and authoritative DNS. authoritative DNS controls website resolution, while recursive DNS only functions as a cache. Therefore, authoritative DNS, the DNS address entered at domain name registrar, is more relevant to a Webmaster. Recursive DNS is used by Internet users.

There are two types of DNS hijacking:
1. Hijacking of authoritative DNS
This attack comes in two ways. The first is to take control of the account registered with the domain name registrar. For example, several years ago, a hacker attacked a company's account registered with the domain name registrar, and modified the NS record of "xx.com". This means the authoritative DNS was changed. This attack controlled the contents from the origin, infecting all recursive DNSs and making all Internet users be redirected to the wrong page. If you use certain tools (such as dig or nslookup) to detect, you will find that all DNS servers have incorrect content. To solve the problem, you need to change the NS record back to your authoritative DNS server and wait until all the recursive DNS caches expire. Only after the data is refreshed can Internet users access the correct website. The second is to intrude into the authoritative DNS server and take full control of the authoritative DNS, which involves great difficulty.
2. Hijacking of recursive DNS
If a DNS system uses unreliable UDP packets for communication, attackers have the chance to fake the authoritative DNS server and use fake data to cheat recursive DNS. Attacks on recursive DNS are usually regional. For example, if a hacker attacks one or several recursive DNS servers, then only the accesses using the attacked DNS(s) are affected. In a test using dig or nslookup, the results for some recursive DNS servers are incorrect, while the others are correct.

Internet users are recommended to use more secure recursive DNS, such as 8.8.8.8 provided by Google. With Google's technical strength, DNS is less likely to be hijacked. If the result returned from 8.8.8.8 is correct, the authoritative DNS service is normal. For Webmasters, it is recommended to ensure the security of account registered with the domain name registrar and use the authoritative DNS services provided by a leading provider.
