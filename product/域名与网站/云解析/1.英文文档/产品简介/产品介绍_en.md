### What is domain name resolution?
After you register a domain name, you only own the right to use this domain name but cannot access your website directly through this domain name or use it as email suffix to send and receive emails. Domain name resolution is an essential step before using your domain name. We usually remember the domain names, but machines can only recognize IP addresses. A domain name corresponds to an IP address. The conversion process between them is called domain name resolution,  which is an automatic process that can only be executed by particular domain name resolution servers. Domain name service (DNS) means to convert a domain name (for example, cloud.tencent.com) into an IP address that can be read by machines (for example, 10.10.10.10).
