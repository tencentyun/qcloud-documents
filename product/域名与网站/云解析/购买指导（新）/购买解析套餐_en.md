After the domain name is added, you can choose to purchase service package first, then modify DNS server at the registrar. The order is irrelevant.
### Select a Package
Cloud DNS provides free package for newly added domain names by default. You can select the domain name from domain name list, click **Free** -> **Upgrade Package** to go to the purchase page for Cloud DNS packages and purchase the package as you need.
