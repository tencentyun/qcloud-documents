## Overview
With the development of science and technology, the number and variety of resources have also increased, and the classification of useful resources has helped to improve work efficiency. More and more people like to use tags to organize their own resource files. Tags can be sorted by factors such as keywords and similarity of content to allow easy search and position in the future. This makes tag management development increasingly important.  
Increasing resources from Tencent Cloud users poses higher demands to resource management. Tencent Cloud provides tags to allow users to query for and manage resources quickly and efficiently. With tags, users can classify and manage existing Tencent Cloud resources and perform resource planning by using preset tags. Tags are words or phrases that act as metadata to identify and organize Tencent Cloud resources. The tag limit varies with the resource, but most can have up to 50 tags.
> **Note:**
> One tag can be applied to multiple resources, and one resource can have multiple tags. A resource can only have one tag key, and one tag key can be applied to multiple resources.
  

## Procedure 
1. Register and log in to your Tencent Cloud account, and then enter the tag console.
2. Do the followings in the tag console:
	- Associate existing resources with tags to create a list of existing resources.
	- Create a tag key list.
