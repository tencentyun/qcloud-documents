### Authorizing a sub-account with all permissions of the message queue it created

A sub-account Developer under the enterprise account CompanyExample wants to assess the message queue it created.

Solution A:

The enterprise account CompanyExample directly authorizes the preset policies QCloudCmqQueueCreaterFullAccess and QCloudCmqTopicCreaterFullAccess to the sub-account Developer. For more information on authorization, please see [Authorization Management](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/8961).

Solution B:

Step 1: Create the following policy using policy syntax

```
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement":
    [
       {
           "effect": "allow",
           "action": "cmqtopic:*",
           "resource": "qcs::cmqtopic:::topicName/uin/${uin}/*"
       },
       {
           "effect": "allow",
           "action": "cmqqueue:*",
           "resource": "qcs::cmqqueue:::queueName/uin/${uin}/*"
       }
    ]
}
```

Step 2: Authorize the policy to the sub-account. For more information on authorization, please see [Authorization Management](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/8961).
