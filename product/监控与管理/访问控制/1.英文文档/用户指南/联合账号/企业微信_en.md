You can authorize Tencent Cloud to access the Contacts of your WeChat Work. And then you can pull certain users from the Contacts of WeChat Work when creating users in CAM, thus facilitating creating sub-users. The steps are as follows:

1.	Log in to [WeChat Work Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/qywx) and click **Activate Now**.

3.	The authorization record can be found in WeChat Work list after authorization. WeChat Work list only records the authorization operation, but will not actively access your WeChat Work Contacts, unless you select **Create Sub-user from WeChat Work** on the **New User** page manually.
