### Authorizing a sub-account with all permissions of messaging services

A sub-account Developer under the enterprise account CompanyExample requires all the permissions of the message queue under this enterprise account. The read and write operations can be performed to the message queue regardless of whether it is based on a topic model or a queue model.

Solution A:

The enterprise account CompanyExample directly authorizes the preset policies QCloudCmqQueueFullAccess and QCloudCmqTopicFullAccess to the sub-account Developer. For more information on authorization, please see [Authorization Management](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/8961).

Solution B:

Step 1: Create the following policy using policy syntax
```
 {
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement":
     {
         "effect": "allow",
         "action": ["cmqtopic:*","camqueue:*"]
         "resource": "*"
     }
}
```

Step 2: Authorize the policy to the sub-account. For more information on authorization, please see [Authorization Management](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/8961).
