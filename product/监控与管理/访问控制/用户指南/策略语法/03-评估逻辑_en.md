When a Tencent Cloud user accesses cloud resources, CAM determines whether to allow or deny the request using the following evaluation logic.
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/b2bd42353bee28c55cc1bb1c3e8bb35d/395.png)    
1 All requests are denied by default.
    
2 CAM checks all policies associated with the current user.
 1. Check whether any policies match. If yes, proceed to the next step. If no, the final result is "deny", and cloud resources are inaccessible.
 2. Check whether the "deny" policy matches. If yes, the final result is "deny", and cloud resources are inaccessible. If no, proceed to the next step.
 3. Check whether the "allow" policy matches. If yes, the final result is "allow", and cloud resources are accessible. If no, the final result is "deny", and cloud resources are inaccessible.
    
>   **Note:**
- Root accounts can access all resources under their names by default. Now, cross-account resource access is only supported for COS/CAS products.
- Some general policies associate all CAM users by default. For more information, please see [General Policy Table](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10605#dsa) below.
-  Other policies need to be explicitly specified, including "allow" and "deny" policies.
- For a service that needs access to cross-account resources, it involves permission propagation, that is, the root account A authorizes a sub-account under the root account B with access to its resources. In this case, CAM verifies the permission authorized to B by A and permission authorized to the sub-account by B. And the sub-account of B can access the resources of A only when both conditions are satisfied.
