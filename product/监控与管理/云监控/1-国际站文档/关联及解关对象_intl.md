After the alarm policy is created, it is essential for you to associate some alarm objects to it to determine which instance objects will send alarms if the alarm trigger conditions are reached.

## Adding Associated Objects
1) Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click "Cloud Monitoring" - "My Alarms" tab, and then click the "Alarm Policy" button.

2) Click the alarm policy ID that needs to be associated with objects in the alarm policy list to enter the details page.

3) In the "Alarm Objects" module, users can click the "Add Association" button in different regions and select corresponding product instances to complete the association.

## Disassociating
In the list of alarm objects, check the instance that needs to be disassociated. Click the "Disassociate" button at the top to cancel the association between the object and the alarm policy.

Or click the "Disassociate All" button to disassociate all the objects in the list.
