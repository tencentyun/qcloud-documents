## Viewing Monitoring Line Charts

1. Move the mouse to a line chart, and all charts on the dashboard show the corresponding linkage views at the same time.
   - Details view: Specific monitoring data of the selected time point is not displayed in the details. You need to click the chart to view specific monitoring data in the sorted list.
   - Aggregation view: Specific monitoring data of the selected time point is displayed in the details. You can easily compare data of various charts with the linkage function.

2. The sorted list can be exported to a local machine by clicking "Export", and can be hidden by clicking "Collapse".

4. Click an instance name in the list, and you will be redirected to the monitoring details page for further troubleshooting.

## Adjusting Time Span and Refresh Frequency for Views

The dashboard displays data over the last one hour by default. And the monitoring data is refreshed in real time.

You can adjust the time span and granularity for all the charts using the time selector in the upper right corner of the dashboard for historical data monitoring and troubleshooting.

You can refresh the view by clicking the refresh button or adjust the refresh frequency using the refresh interval drop-down box in the upper right corner of the dashboard.
