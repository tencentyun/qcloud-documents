As a core concept in Cloud Monitor, a metric represents the performance data of a user' system. Metric data is the specific monitoring data of each cloud service, and represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to Cloud Monitor. You can retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time-series data.

Cloud Monitor provides users with data granularities of 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour and 1 day, each with a different data storage period.

| Granularity | Storage period |
| ---- | ---- |
| 10s | 1 day |
| 1 min | 15 days |
| 5 min | 62 days |
| 1h | 186 days |
| 1d | 372 days |

The storage period refers to the period of time from when monitoring data is collected from Cloud Monitor to when the monitoring data is terminated due to expiration.

> If your cloud resources are reclaimed or terminated, the monitoring data generated by the cloud resources will not be removed immediately. Cloud Monitor will still store and manage the monitoring data of the terminated instance for a specific storage period.

You can view the monitoring data generated by the cloud resources under your account on the front-end console or using API. If the resource object to view is not reclaimed or terminated, you can view the monitoring data on the front-end console. If the destination instance does not exist, you need to pull the monitoring data using API.
