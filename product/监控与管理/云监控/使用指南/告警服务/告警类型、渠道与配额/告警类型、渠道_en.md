## Alarm Channel

Currently, Tencent Cloud supports sending alarm messages via SMS and email.

All alarms are sent via these two channels by default. If you just want to receive alarms from one channel, you can go to the Tencent Cloud console and check if your email/mobile phone has been correctly configured and verified.

There is a quota limit for the SMS channel (no limit for email channel). Once the SMS quota is reached, alarms will no longer be sent via this channel.
