Cloud Monitor is the monitoring platform developed by Tencent with years of experience accumulated in independent research and development. Cloud Monitor is provided with the following advantages:

## Automatic Activation
You don't need to intentionally purchase or activate Cloud Monitor, which is automatically activated with the Tencent Cloud account, so you can directly check the status of cloud services and set alarms in cloud monitor after purchasing and using Tencent Cloud services. 

## Multi-metric Monitoring
Cloud monitor provides cloud service load and performance metrics including CVM CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk utilization and cloud database, memcached high-speed storage, which will be shown in intuitive charts.

## Fine-grained monitoring

One minute granularity monitoring covers most of the products, such as cloud servers, cloud databases, VPCs and cloud hard disks. As well,  the second-level monitoring of five-second granularity will be introduced subsequently.

## Custom Alarm Threshold
It supports the configuration of alarm triggering thresholds for multiple metrics, and each policy can associate different cloud products. After an alarm threshold is set to be the default alarm policy, the newly purchased cloud product will automatically associate the policy. You can customize the alarm recipients and delivery channels.

## Alarm Channel Service
Cloud monitor also provides a custom alarm channel service, so that you can generate a custom alarm by monitoring the script, which is to be reported through the Alarm Report API to the cloud monitor and pushed to you therefrom in time.
