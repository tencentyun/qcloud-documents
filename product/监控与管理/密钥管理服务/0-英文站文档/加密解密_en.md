Tencent Cloud provides APIs, SDKs and online tools for small data (< 4 KB) encryption and decryption. You can choose accordingly based on your needs and scenarios.

## APIs and SDKs

In most cases, developers use cloud APIs and SDKs to encrypt/decrypt certificates or keys. For details, please see:

* [API Overview](/document/product/573/8899)
* [C++ SDK](/document/product/573/8902)
* [JAVA SDK](/document/product/573/8903)
* [Python SDK](/document/product/573/8904)
* [PHP SDK](/document/product/573/8905)


## Online Visualized Tools

Online tools are suitable for one-time or non-batch encryption and decryption operations, such as the initial generation of a key ciphertext. With online tools, developers can concentrate on the core business without developing tools for non-batch encryption and decryption. The operation steps are as follows:
