| Scenario | Security Risk | KMS Solution |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Certificates, key protection | Web pages or application developers need to use certificates and keys when providing services such as HTTPS. Attackers can easily obtain keys stored in plaintext | A key is encrypted through the KMS API or online tools and the ciphertext file of the key is stored locally. The file is then decrypted through the API but not stored locally before using, so it is difficult for the attackers to obtain the key |
| Core intellectual property protection | Developers that establish their industry competitive advantage through core intellectual property need strict protection of their core intellectual property. Once it is disclosed, the impact on the company cannot be measured. Some developers encrypt the sensitive data before storage, but they cannot guarantee the security of data keys | All core data are encrypted using data keys and stored in the corresponding storage containers. However, data keys are encrypted with KMS, without valid permissions. Therefore, decryption is impossible even if the data key and data of the ciphertext are obtained |
| Protocol and communication protection | Governments and financial institutions are always exposed to highly sensitive information in daily work communication. The protocols between different terminals and different servers need to be encrypted. However, the key used to encrypt protocol packets may have security problem | Key Management Service provides key encryption protection and permission management services |
