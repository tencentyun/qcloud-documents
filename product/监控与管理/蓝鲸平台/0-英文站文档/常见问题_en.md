## 2. Which peripheral systems does the Failure Self-recovery rely on? 

Failure Self-recovery relies on "Configuration Console" and "Job Platform":

- You need to create a business on the BlueKing "Configuration Console" in advance and enter your server data into the [Configuration Console](http://o.qcloud.com/console?app=cc-new).
- If you want to execute a custom job (such as starting a process) on [Job Platform](http://o.qcloud.com/console?app=job), you need to deploy [BlueKing Agent](http://o.qcloud.com/console/?app=agent-setup) on your server.
