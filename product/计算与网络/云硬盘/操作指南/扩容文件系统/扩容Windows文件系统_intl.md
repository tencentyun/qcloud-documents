Capacity expansion for Windows cloud disk can be divided into two scenarios:

- Format the new capacity space as a new separate partition while the old partition remains unchanged.
- Expand the old partition to the new empty space while keeping the data of the old partition unchanged.

In the two scenarios above, after your Windows cloud disk is successfully upgraded (the cloud disk capacity change can be seen), you can complete the partition expansion through the partition expansion tool Partition Assistant in Windows while keeping the original data unaffected.

## Prerequisites
- You need to download [Partition Assistant](http://www.disktool.cn/).
- Complete the [capacity expansion of cloud disk](/doc/product/362/5747).
- If the cloud disk is not formatted and no file system is created, and the capacity is directly added to the original empty cloud disk, you can refer to [Partitioning, Formatting, and File System Creation on Windows System](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/6734) 
to perform subsequent operations.

## Formatting New Space as an Independent Partition
Open the Partition Assistant, and you can find the unused capacity of the new disk space:

Right-click the unused disk space, and select **Create Partition**:

In the pop-up box, enter the desired partition size, drive letter, and file system, and then click the **OK** button:

## Adding New Space to Existing Partition Space
Right-click the partition to be expanded, and select **Adjust/Move Partition (R)**:

![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/aab479952f267a19585c789a9511cd84/image.png)

After confirming the partition expansion information again, click the **Yes** button:
![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/d9c99392f4542bebc1087f9d6790e722/image.png)

After the partition capacity expansion is completed, click **OK**:
