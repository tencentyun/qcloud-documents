You can create a cloud disk and connect it to any CVM instance in the same availability zone. Through block storage device mapping, the cloud disk is recognized and used by CVM instances. You can also launch a new cloud disk based on the snapshots you just created. For more information, please see [Create Cloud Disk from Snapshot](/doc/product/362/5757). The created cloud disk can reach its optimal performance without warm-up.

The method to create cloud disk varies with types of cloud disks. For more information about cloud disk types, please see [Categories of Cloud Disks](/doc/product/362/2353).
