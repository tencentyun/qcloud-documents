We provide the following two ways to purchase a cloud disk:

- **Snapshot purchase**:
If you need to keep the data disk snapshots in the newly created disk, you can select the method.
Log in to [Snapshot Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/snapshot), and click "Create Cloud Block Storage" behind the snapshot you want to use to purchase a cloud disk.

   > Note: The capacity of newly purchased disk may be greater than or equal to the snapshot size.


## Purchasing Channels for Local/Non-elastic Cloud Disk
Local disk and non-elastic cloud disk can only be purchased when you purchase a CVM and cannot be purchased separately. For more information, please refer to the [Purchasing and Activating Instance](/doc/product/213/4855).
