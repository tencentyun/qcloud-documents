## Purchasing Channels for Elastic Cloud Disk

You can purchase a cloud disk in the following two ways:

### Common Purchase
Log in to the [Cloud Block Storage Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/cbs) and click **+ New** to purchase.

### Snapshot Purchase
If you need to keep the data disk snapshots in the created disk, this method is recommended.
Log in to the [Snapshot Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/snapshot), and click **Create Cloud Disk** at the end of the snapshot you want to use to purchase a cloud disk.

 > **Note:**
 The capacity of the purchased disk can be greater than or equal to the snapshot size.


## Purchasing Channels for Local/Non-elastic Cloud Disks
Local disks and non-elastic cloud disks can only be purchased when you purchase a CVM and cannot be purchased separately. For more information, please see the [Purchase and Launch Instance](/doc/product/213/4855).
