| Advantage | Tencent Cloud CCS | Self-built CCS |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Easy to use |<b>Simplify cluster management</b><br>With the help of Tencent Cloud's CCS, you can complete all the cluster management tasks by enabling container cluster only without the need to work with cluster management software or design container cluster architecture | Self-built container management infrastructure generally involves installation, operation and expansion of your own cluster management software, configuration of management system and solution monitoring, and it is complex to manage |
| Flexible to scale |<b>Flexible cluster hosting and integrated load balancer</b><br>The stable service operation is guaranteed by flexible running of applications and batch tasks, automatic scale-up/down of services, as well as automatic pulling of failure data | Container service is deployed manually based on business traffic and health status, and both availability and scalability are poor |
| Secure and stable |<b>High isolation of resources and high availability of services</b><br>Users use computing resources exclusively; clusters run in the VPC; auto-recovery from failure and rapid migration of services are supported | For self-built CCS, the isolation of tenants, devices, kernel modules is poor due to problematic kernel and inadequate Namespace |
| Efficient |<b>Image is deployed rapidly and business is integrated persistently</b><br>Images are uploaded and downloaded rapidly, and a massive number of containers are enabled in seconds. CCS is used to build, test and integrate images | The self-built CCS offers no guarantee of network availability, so the container cannot be created efficiently using image |
| Low-cost |<b>Free of charge</b><br>Tencent Cloud's CCS is provided at no extra cost, you are only charged for the cloud resources you created to store and run applications | You need to invest money to build, install, maintain and expand your own cluster management infrastructure, which is costly |
