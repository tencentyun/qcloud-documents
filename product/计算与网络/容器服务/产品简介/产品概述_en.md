Tencent Cloud's Cloud Container Service (CCS) is a solution for container cluster building and OPS management for users, to seamlessly connect to Tencent Cloud's computing, network, storage, monitoring, security capabilities, and help users upgrade development mode, change application delivery, and reconfigure the data management mode. Tencent Cloud's CCS is designed to accelerate the deployment of applications, simplify the cluster management, and help enterprises migrate business into the cloud quickly.

The following concepts will help you get familiar with Tencent Cloud's CCS:

- **[Cluster](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/457/6779)**: A collection of cloud resources required to run the container, which contains a few CVMs, load balancers, and other Tencent Cloud resources.
- **[Node](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/457/6995)**: A CVM registered in the cluster.
- **[Service](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/457/6780)**: A microservice comprised of multiple containers with the same configuration and rules for access to these containers.
- **[Image](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/457/6781)**: The Docker image used to deploy services. Each image is specified with an unique ID (image's repository address + image name + image tag).
