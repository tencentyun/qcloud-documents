A node is a CVM registered in a cluster. Multiple nodes compose a cluster. Tencent TKE supports adding both new and existing nodes to the cluster.
>**Note:**
>Currently, existing nodes can only be added to the cluster within the same VPC. The reuse of CVM resources in the basic network and different VPCs will be available in the future.

## Preconditions
You need to create a cluster first. For more information on how to create a cluster, please see [New Cluster](/doc/product/457/9091).

## Adding a Node
1. Log in to [TKE Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ccs).
2. Click **Cluster** on the left navigation bar, and click **Add Node** on the right of the cluster list.

2. Set **Network**, **Model** and **Configuration** for the new node.

## Adding an Existing Node
1. Log in to [TKE Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ccs).

4. Enter CVM configuration. Three login methods are provided.
 - **Set Password**: Set a password according to instructions.
 - **Associate with key immediately**: Key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. It is a more secure method to log in to CVM than a password. For more information, please see [SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
 - **Automatically generated password**: The automatically generated password is sent to you through the internal message.

>**Note:**
>1. Currently, only the CVM under the same VPC can be added.
>2. If you add an existing CVM to the cluster, the operating system of CVM should be reinstalled.
