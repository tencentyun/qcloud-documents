3. Configure the basic cluster information.
 - **Cluster name**: The name of a cluster to be created should be limited to 63 characters in length. 
 - **Billing method**: Two billing methods are supported: Prepaid and Postpaid. For more information, please see [Billing Method](/doc/product/213/2180).
 - **Region**: Select a closest region based on your location. This helps minimize access latency and improve download speed.
 - **Availability zone**: Clusters in the same region are interconnected with each other through private network, but this is not the case for those distributed in different regions. The same region is to be chosen for users who want to take advantage of communication over private networks.
 - **Node network**: The system assigns the IP addresses within the node network address range to the CVMs in the cluster. For more information, please see [Network Configuration of Containers and Nodes](/doc/product/457/9083).
 - **Container network**: The system assigns the IP addresses within the container network address range to the containers in the cluster. For more information, please see [Network Configuration of Containers and Nodes](/doc/product/457/9083).
 - **Cluster description**: Information about cluster creation. This information is displayed on **Cluster Information** page.

4. Select a model (all models with cloud disks as system disks are supported).
 - **Series**: **Series 1** and **Series 2** are available. For more information, please see [Pod Types](/doc/product/213/7153#.E5.8F.AF.E7.94.A8.E5.AE.9E.E4.BE.8B.E7.B1.BB.E5.9E.8B2).
 - **Model**: For more information about the model options, please see [Select CVM Configuration Option](/doc/product/213/2764#.E7.A1.AE.E5.AE.9A.E4.BA.91.E6.9C.8D.E5.8A.A1.E5.99.A8.E9.85.8D.E7.BD.AE.E6.96.B9.E6.A1.88).

5. Enter CVM configuration.
 - **System disk**: Always 50 GB.
 - **Data disk**: The maximum value is 4,000 GB, with a step width of 10 GB.
 - **Public bandwidth**: Two billing methods are available. For more information, please see [Purchase Network Bandwidth](/doc/product/213/509).
 - **Bandwidth**: If you check **Assign public IP for free**, the system assigns a public IP at no cost. If there is no need, set bandwidth value to 0.
 - **Login method**: Three login methods are provided.
i. **Set password**: Set a password according to instructions. ii **Immediately Associate Key**: A key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. It is much safer to log in to a CVM with such key than a regular key. For more information, please see [SSH Key](/doc/product/213/503).
iii. **Automatically Generate Password**: The automatically generated password will be sent to you through the internal message.
 - **Security group**: It functions as a firewall and is used to set the network access control of CVMs. For more information, please see [Configuration of CCS Security Groups](/doc/product/457/9084).
 - **Number of CVMs**: Select the number of CVMs.
