Tencent Cloud CCS supports grouping services by application. You can add multiple services with high relevance into one application for unified management, thus simplifying the service management.

## Main Operations Supported for Application

Applications can be quickly created and updated with "application template + configurations". You are allowed to deploy and update services in the application separately. For more information on operations, please see:

- [Create Application][1]
- [Delete Application][2]
- [Update Application][3]
- [View Application][4]
- [Manage Services in the Application][5]

For more information on application management, please see [Application Management Overview][7].
