## Building Container Images Manually with Dockerfile
### Building with Dockerfile
If you don't want to build a container image through git code repository, you can do this by manually uploading Dockerfile. In this way, you need to prepare a Dockerfile file that specifies the dependent base image and other resources which must be accessed through public network.


### Building images
Click a registry in the image registry list to go to the details page, and then select the "Build Image" tab, on which you can view the image building history.
