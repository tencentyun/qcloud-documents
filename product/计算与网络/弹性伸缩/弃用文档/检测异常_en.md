AS boasts a powerful feature called "in-advance abnormity detection".

In some cases such as insufficient balance or wrongly deletion of image, it is impossible to create CVMs needed in a scale-up. AS will detect these abnormities in advance and send an alarm. You can identify risks before the scaling activity fails, preventing losses at an early stage.

You can directly check it in the scaling configuration list. As shown below, "Invalid" in the "Validity" column indicates that your scaling configuration has become unavailable due to misoperation. The reason for the invalidity will be displayed if you hover the cursor over it.
