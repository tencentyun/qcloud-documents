Scaling configuration is a template for automatic creation of CVM. It contains image ID, CVM instance type, system disk/data disk types and capacities, key pair, security group, etc.

Scaling configuration must be specified when the scaling group is created. Once the scaling configuration is created, its attributes cannot be edited.
