If you have created a notification and specified the recipient, AS will send the notification to the specified person(s) when a scaling activity occurs.

### Step 1:  Define the recipient of the notification

Go to [User Management Console](https://console.qcloud.com/cam) and you will see the contact information of the account registrant.

If you want more people to receive the notification, such as other members from the operation and maintenance team, you can click **New** to create more.

> Note:
> If you are the only user of your Tencent cloud account, you can skip this step, because the system has a "developer" account created by default.

### Step 2:  Define user group (recipient classification)

AS sends a notification on a **user group** basis, rather than **recipient**.

**Scenario example:**

- If you wish you are the only person to receive the notification, you can create a user group with your contact info only.

- You have defined a number of notification recipients, who may be in the same or different departments. You may wish that a certain type of notifications to be sent to the recipients of department A, and another type to the recipients of department B. Then you can define a user group, and put the different notification recipients to this particular user group.

**How to set up:**
1. Go to [User Group Management](https://console.qcloud.com/cam/groups), click **New User Group**, fill in the user name and click **OK**.
2. Then click **Add User** to add the relevant notification recipient(s).

### Step 3: Use user groups

When you define the alarm triggering policy and notification policy of the AS, you can see the user groups you have defined in the list of recipients. You can set a specific user group to be notified as needed.
