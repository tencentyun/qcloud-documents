| Term | Description |
|---------|---------|
| BGP | Border gateway protocol, a routing protocol of an autonomous system that runs on TCP. |
| Unicast | Unicast transmission. A data channel needs to be established between the client and the media server. Each packet sent from a server can only be delivered to a client. |
| Multicast | Multicast transmission, which enables point-to-multipoint network connection between the sender and each receiver. If a sender wants to transmit the same data to multiple receivers at a time, he/she only needs to copy a same packet. |
| Broadcast | Broadcast means to broadcast the packets in an IP subnet, and all the CVMs in the subnet will receive these packets. |
| Anycast	 | Anycast refers to the communication between a sender and a nearest group of receivers. When a unicast address is assigned to more than one API, the messages sent to these APIs are routed by the network to the "closest" destination API as measured by the routing protocol. |
