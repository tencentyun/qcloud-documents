### **Anycast**
Anycast is the communication between a sender and the nearest group of receivers. When a unicast address is assigned to more than one interfaces, the message sent to the interfaces is routed by the network to the nearest destination interface measured by the routing protocol.

### **BGP**
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a routing protocol running on TCP for autonomous systems.

### **Broadcast**
Broadcast refers to broadcasting packets in an IP subnet where all the servers in the subnet will receive these packets.

### **Multicast**
Multicast achieves a one-to-many network connection between the sender and each receiver. If the sender transfers the same data to multiple receivers at the same time, only one packet needs to be copied.

### **Unicast**
Unicast establishes an individual data channel between the client and the media server where all the packets from the server can only be sent to the client.
