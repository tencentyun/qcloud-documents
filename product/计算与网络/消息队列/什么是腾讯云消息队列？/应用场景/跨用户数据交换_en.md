Tencent Cloud CMQ can also satisfy the demands for data exchange across IDC data centers and different users. If two parties need to communicate with each other in the case that the networks cannot be interconnected or the routing information (such as IP and port) of applications is not known (for example, two companies both have their businesses deployed on Tencent Cloud, but they do not know each other's service address), they can achieve data exchange in such a way that one party sends messages to and the other party receives the messages from the queue agreed upon by both parties.

- Tencent Cloud CMQ supports data exchange across data centers. The demands for data exchange and data synchronization between Company A and Company B can be easily realized without the need to connect the private networks of Companies A and B, and to expose the LANs within the companies to the public network environment.
- Tencent Cloud CMQ provides HTTPS+Key to meet the demand for data exchange through public networks, which ensures data security and efficiency.
