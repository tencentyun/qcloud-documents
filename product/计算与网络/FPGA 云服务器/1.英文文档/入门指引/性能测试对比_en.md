> Note: The above figure is the result of a comparison test of 10,764 images using the Alexnet model;
CPU server with Intel Xeon E5-2620v3
FPGA server with Tencent Cloud FCC instance

**Performance Test Conclusion:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceleration performance of Tencent Cloud FCC instance is over **5** times higher than that of the CCC instance.
