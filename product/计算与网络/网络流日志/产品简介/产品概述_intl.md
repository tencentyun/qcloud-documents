## Overview
Flow Logs allows **full-time, full-flow and non-intrusive** capture of ENI traffic for the real-time storage and analysis of network traffic, helping you deal with **troubleshooting, compliance audit, architecture optimization and security testing** and making your cloud network more stable, secure and intelligent.

With VPC flow logs, you can capture incoming/outgoing ENI IP traffic in a VPC. When a flow log is created, you can view and search for its data in [Cloud Log Service](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/cls). You can also deliver specified flow logs to other products for analysis or storage, for example, deliver a flow log to COS bucket and manage its lifecycle for log audit.

>**Note:** Flow Logs is under internal trial. [You can apply for it now](https://cloud.tencent.com/act/apply/VPCFlowLogs).
