The following should be considered when you use flow logs:
- Flow Logs service is only supported for the ENI in VPC and is not supported for basic network-based CVM, database, gateway, peering connection and other services.
- You cannot change the configuration of a flow log (for example, modify the cloud log service that the flow log is delivered to) after creating it. But you can delete the flow log and create a new flow log with the required configuration.
- Not all types of IP traffic will be captured by flow logs. The following types of traffic will not be logged:
 - The traffic that is generated by Windows instance for activation of Windows license.
 - DHCP traffic.
