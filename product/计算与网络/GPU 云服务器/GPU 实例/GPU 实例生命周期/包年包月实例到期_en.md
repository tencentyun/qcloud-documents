Prepaid GCC instances cannot be terminated by users. A prepaid CVM instance comes to the end of its lifecycle and is automatically terminated by the system if it is not renewed within 7 days upon its expiration.

Prepaid GCC instance is shut down automatically on the expiry date and moved to the Recycle Bin. It will be retained for 7 calendar days, during which you can renew and recover it. The instance is terminated if it is not renewed within 7 calendar days.
You can set auto renewal when buying an instance. You can also [renew, or enable auto renewal](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/560/8057) for the prepaid instances before the expiration time to avoid service interruption.

## Reclaiming Instance

GCC instances are reclaimed in the same way as CVM instances. For more information, please see [Reclaiming CVM Instance](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4931#.E5.AE.9E.E4.BE.8B.E5.9B.9E.E6.94.B6)
