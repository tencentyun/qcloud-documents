## Mass Computing Processing
GCC instances provide powerful computing capability to perform operations on mass data processing, such as search, big data recommendation, intelligent input method:
	•	With GCC instances, the data operation that used to take several days now only takes few hours.
	•	Cluster computing that used to be implemented using dozens of CCC instances is now completed with a single GCC instance.

## Deep Learning Model
GCC instance serves as a training platform for deep learning:
1.	GCC instance can directly accelerate the computing service and communicate externally.
2.	GCC instance can be used in combination with CVM which provides computing platform for GCC instance.
3.	COS provides GCC instance with cloud storage service for massive data.
