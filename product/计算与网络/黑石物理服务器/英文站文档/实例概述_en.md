An instance is a Cloud Physical Machine (CPM) you purchased. Instances with different types provide different computing capacity, storage space, and storage redundancy, from which you can choose based on your business needs. When Tencent Cloud delivers an instance to you, you have full control permission of this CPM, including startup, shutdown, out-of-band management, etc.

## Instance Types
Tencent Cloud provides a wide range of instance types for various business scenarios, including computing instance, storage instance, memory instance, standard instance, etc. For different instance types, the configurations are different in CPU, memory size, storage media, storage capacity, storage redundancy and other dimensions.

*For more information on instance types, please see [Instance Type](/doc/product/386/7035) section*

## Storage

CPMs with different models are configured with local disks with different media, APIs, and capacities. You can choose different types and numbers of disks based on your business needs. If data redundancy is required for your business, you are recommended to purchase a CPM with RAID card.
