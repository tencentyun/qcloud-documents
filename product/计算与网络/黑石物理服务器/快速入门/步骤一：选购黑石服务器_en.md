This section describes how to access the purchase page of CPM and select the appropriate CPM based on your business needs.

## Accessing the Purchase Page
Access the [CPM Purchase Page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cpm "CPM Purchase Page")

## Selecting a Region
Select a data center that is closest to your users</br>
Users will have shorter access latency and higher access speed if the data center is close to them. For example, if most of your users are located near Yangtze River Delta, Shanghai region would be a good choice. If most of your users are located in the north, Beijing region would be optimal.

## Selecting CPM Configuration
This tutorial is based on a scenario where one Web application server will be deployed. Web servers are mainly used to satisfy the need for accessing pages without the need for strong computing capability, and only a small amount of storage space is required to record application log.
With this in mind, we select a CPM with the code "PC100".
