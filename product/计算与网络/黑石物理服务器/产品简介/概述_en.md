Cloud Physical Machine (CPM) is an on-demand physical server rental service provided on a pay-by-usage basis, designed to offer high-performance, securely isolated physical clusters dedicated to cloud. With this service, all you need to do is specifying the configuration and quantity of CPMs. The time taken in deployment and delivery will be shortened to 4 hours. Tencent Cloud will take care of the server supply and operation & maintenance, allowing you to focus your attention on business innovation. </br>

Compared with self-built data center, CPM allows you to build your private cloud faster, with Tencent Cloud providing interconnection between data center private　networks, VPCs, BM　load balancers, NAT gateway, operation and maintenance, monitoring, security protection and other capabilities.</br>

*CPM is an exclusive physical server rental service, not a cloud server (virtual server) rental service*
