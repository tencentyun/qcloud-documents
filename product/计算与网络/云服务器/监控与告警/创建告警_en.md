You can create an alert that triggers when there are status changes for Cloud products, and send the related messages. Alerts that are created will determine whether a notification needs to be triggered based on the metrics monitored at a certain interval, relative to a given threshold.

You can take the appropriate precautions or recovery actions immediately after an alert triggers due to status changes. Therefore, reasonably creating alerts will help improve the robustness and reliability of your applications. For more details on alerts, refer to [Create alerts](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/248/1073).

- An alert triggering condition is a semantic condition consisting of a metric, a comparison relation, a threshold, a statistical period and a duration. For example, the index for 'CPU utilization'; comparison relationship as '>'; threshold at '80%'; a '5 minute' statistical cycle; sustained cycle for '2 cycles'; this means that: every 5 minutes CPU utilization data will be collected; if a CVM's CPU utilization is greater than 80% continuously twice in a row, an alert will be triggered.

Each alert strategy is a set of alert triggering conditions. An alert triggering condition is an "OR" relationship. That is, when a condition is met, an alert is sent. The alert is sent to all users associated with the alert strategy. After receiving the alert, the user can view the information and take corresponding measures.
