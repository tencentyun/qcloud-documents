The hardware for Tencent Cloud instances can be adjusted easily and quickly, which is a key feature of cloud virtual machines that makes them more usable than physical machines. In the initial stage of application when the request volume is low, you can choose low hardware configuration. As the application quickly expands and the request volume surges, you can quickly adjust the hardware configuration to process the services faster and better cater to your changing demand.
