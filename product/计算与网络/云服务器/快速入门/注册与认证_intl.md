To facilitate your effective use of Tencent Cloud CVM, please complete the following steps to set up the CVM:

## Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account

If you already have a Tencent Cloud account, you can skip the sign-up step and make the following settings.

If you need to **Register** in the Tencent Cloud official website, see [Sign up for Tencent Cloud](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/9603) for registration instructions.
 
## Qualification Verification

After you have signed up as a Tencent Cloud user, you need to go through qualification verification before the use of some products (such as the Postpaid CVM, COS, CDN). When you have passed the qualification verification, you can use all of Tencent Cloud services by default (except for those that specifically need a separate application for activation).

1. After the sign-up, click the button on the top right corner of the page to enter **User Center**:
