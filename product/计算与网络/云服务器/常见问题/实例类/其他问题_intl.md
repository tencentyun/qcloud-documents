### What to do if I can't see my CVM on the console?

If you find that your CVM does not exist on the console, verifying the following:

1. Check the Recycle Bin to verify whether the instance has expired.
2. Verify whether the instance has been terminated because it has expired for more than 7 days.
3. Verify whether you have selected a wrong project.

If none of the above applies, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to contact us.
