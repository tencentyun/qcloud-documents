### A user has purchased a Linux CVM that comes with an over-20 GB Cloud Block Storage. How will it be charged if the user reinstalls the operating system as Windows?

The charges will be calculated based on the billing method:

- If it is a prepaid CVM, a refund will be made (exclusive of the amount of voucher used in payment) according to the payment conditions.
- If it is a postpaid CVM, the calculation of configuration charge for the part exceeding 20 GB of the system disk will be stopped (i.e. the system disk will be free of charge afterwards) after the operating system is changed to Windows.

### A user has purchased a Windows CVM that comes with a Cloud Block Storage. How will it be charged if the user reinstalls the operating system as Linux?

Since the system disk does not support capacity reduction, when a 50 GB Windows Cloud Block Storage is changed to Linux, the capacity shall be kept and corresponding fees for the Cloud Block Storage shall be paid. (The first 20 GB is free of charge, and fees for another 30 GB shall be paid).
