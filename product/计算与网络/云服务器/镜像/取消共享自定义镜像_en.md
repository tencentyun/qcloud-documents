You can at any time cancel the status of sharing images with others, to decide not sharing them with a certain user. This operation does not affect instances that other users have created using this shared image, but other users can no longer see the image or create more new instances using this image.

## Cancel image sharing on Console
1) Open [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.qcloud.com).

2) Click "CVM" – "Image" in the navigation pane.

3) Click the "Custom Images" tab. Find out the custom image you want to unshare and click the "More" – "Unshare" button. Select the account you want to unshare, click the "Unshare" button and confirm the operation to unshare the image.

## Unshare images via API
You can use the CancelShareImage API to unshare images. For details, refer to [CancelShareImage API](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/api/229/2390).
