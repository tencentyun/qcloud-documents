If you want to continue using your CVM when it expires, our [CVM Renewal](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/213/6143) will guide you through manual or automatic renewal to avoid data loss or interruption of service due to instances being terminated by the system upon expiration.

If you choose low hardware configuration in the initial stage of application where the volume of requests is low, as applications quickly increasing and request volume surging, we can use [Adjust the Instance Configuration](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/213/5730) for quick hardware adjustment to improve service processing speed and better cater to your new requirements.

You may still encounter other [FAQ on CVM management](https://www.qcloud.com/doc/product/213/2539). We provide a set of frequently asked questions for your reference in order to help you quickly locate and solve the problem.
