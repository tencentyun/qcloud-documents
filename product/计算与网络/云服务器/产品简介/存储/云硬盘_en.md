Tencent Cloud's Cloud Block Storage provides storage at data block level for CVM instances. As a storage medium with high availability and high reliability, Tencent Cloud's Cloud Block Storage comes with a variety of hard drives to cater to the diversified needs of users in read/write operations. For more information about Cloud Block Storage, see [Cloud Block Storage product documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/362).

In case of frequent data changes that require faster read/write speed and persistent storage, you're recommended to use Tencent Cloud's Cloud Block Storage. Cloud disks can be mounted to any running instance in the same availability zone, just like an ordinary mobile hard disk. It is particularly suitable to be used as such application like instance's file system and database storage, with data existing independently of instance's life cycle. For more information about mounting the Cloud Block Storage to an instance, see [Connect Cloud Disks to a CVM instance](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/362/2922#2.-.E6.8C.82.E8.BD.BD.E5.BC.B9.E6.80.A7.E4.BA.91.E7.A1.AC.E7.9B.98).
