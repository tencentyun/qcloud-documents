## FPGA FX2 Overview
**FPGA FX2 instance** is a FPGA-based (Field Programmable Gate Array) computing service that features high throughput, low latency and low power consumption. It accelerates the cloud computing in various seniors at the hardware level.
> **Note:**
> FPGA FX2 is now under internal trial. Meanwhile the public development image provided by Tencent Cloud is CentOS 7.2 (64-bit) driven by FPGA with hardware programming tools.

## Application Scenarios
FPGA FX2 instances are applicable for massive repetitive tasks that requires concurrent computing and low latency.
 - Machine learning computing
 - Natural language processing and speech recognition
 - Computational finance
 - Real-time video processing
 - Image compression
 - Genomics research and computing


## Hardware Specification
- **Processor:** Xilinx Kintex UltraScale KU115 FPGA.
- **Memory:** DDR4, with a particular PCle x8.
- **Storage:** SSD cloud disk.	 
- **Network:** Network enhancement (10-gigabit) is available by default.

**FX2 instances are available in three configurations:**
