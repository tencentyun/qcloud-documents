Series 1 features Intel Xeon CPU and DDR3 memory.

#### Standard S1

The Standard S1 of Series 1 is a type of virtual machines with CPUs ranging from low to high core count. It features moderate prices and flexible options of configurations to meet different needs of users. It also offers the options of local disks, common cloud disks and SSD cloud disks for the data disks (The option may vary with different hardware specifications).

It is recommended that the Standard be used for medium- and small-sized Web applications and databases.

**Features:**
- With CPUs ranging from low to high core count, offering users flexible options to configure the CVM
- With the options of local disks, common cloud disks and SSD cloud disks for the storage
- Balance among compute, memory and network resources, moderate price

#### High IO I1

High IO I1 of Series 1 is a virtual machine of which both the system disks and data disks are high-performance SSDs. It can satisfy high requirements for disk accessing and latency.

It is recommended that the product be applied in IO intensive business.

**Features:**

-  The performance of the random IOPS of SSD local disks is nearly 10 times higher than that of local HDD and common cloud disks.
 - High random IOPS, with up to 40,000 random read IOPS in typical scenarios (blocksize =4k, iodepth =32);
 - High throughput, with up to 300MB/s random read throughput in typical scenarios (blocksize =4k, iodepth =32);
- Low latency, with the access latency in microseconds

#### Memory M1

The Memory M1 of Series 1 is a model of which the ratio of CPU to memory is 1:8, which is suitable for applications that need extensive memory operations, search, and computing.

**Features:**

- All with 10 gigabit underlying networks, providing a more powerful computing capacity and a wider range of memory.
- Intel Xeon E5-2670 v3 processor and DDR3 memory, providing larger-sized instances with stronger computing capacities.
- The Memory Intensive employs a golden ratio, able to satisfy large-scale business deployment.
