If you want to remove all instances that were purchased and started from this image, you can refer to [Expiration of Prepaid Instances](/doc/product/213/4931) or [Terminate Postpaid Instances](/doc/product/213/4930).

> - If you have already shared a custom image to others ([see here](/doc/product/213/4944)), you cannot delete it. You need to cancel all of its sharing before deleting a custom image.
> - You can only delete the custom image, but neither the common image nor the shared image.
