To help users manage CVMs on the CVM console and quickly identify them by name, Tencent Cloud supports naming CVMs. You can modify a CVM's name at any time, and the new name takes effect immediately.


## Modifying Name of an Instance

- Enter the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index), and select the CVM that needs to be renamed.
- Click **More** -> **CVM Settings** -> **Rename** on the page.
- On the renaming page, enter a new CVM name, and then click **OK**.

## Modifying Names of Multiple Instances
- Enter the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index), and select multiple CVMs that need to be renamed.
- Click **More** -> **Rename** on the page.
