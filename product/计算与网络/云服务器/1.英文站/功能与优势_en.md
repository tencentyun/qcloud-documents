## Comprehensive
Tencent Cloud CVM provides comprehensive and extensive service contents for you.

- **Available in multiple regions and availability zones**: South China, East China and North China are covered domestically. Overseas nodes are deployed in Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto and the Silicon Valley respectively. Deployment of applications in regions close to the location of your users allows lower latency.
- **Four model configurations**:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Standard** (suitable for small and medium Web applications and databases)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**High IO** (suitable for I/O intensive applications with low latency)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Memory** (suitable for applications that require extensive memory operations, searches and computing)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Computing** (suitable for large game servers and advertisement service engines, high performance computing and other compute-intensive applications)
- **Generation II CVM**: It comes with Intel Broadwell (v4) CPU and DDR4 memory and delivers a better computing capacity. Used in combination with network enhancement, it can achieve a packet forwarding speed of up to 300k pps and double the integer and floating-point computing performance to deliver a more powerful overall computing capacity.

## Elastic

## Ease of use
A wide range of officially verified application software and operation and maintenance tools make operation and maintenance more convenient, so that you no longer have to worry about tool management.

- Tencent Cloud CVM provides a Web-based user interface, the Console, allowing you to perform operations such as launching, configuration adjustment and system re-installation on CVM instances just as with physical machines. If you have signed up for a Tencent Cloud account, you can directly [log in to the CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm) to operate on your CVM.

- Tencent Cloud CVM provides API system, which can be used for easy integration of CVM and your internal monitoring and operation systems to achieve business operation and maintenance system that closely meets business demands and is fully automated. These requests are HTTP/HTTPS requests. For more information about CVM API operations, please see [API Documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api/213/568).

- If you want to use API to manage your resources, applications and data, you can use SDK (supporting PHP/Python/Java/.NET/Node.js) for programming or use Tencent Cloud CLI to call CVM API. For more information, please see [Use SDK](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/developer-resource) and [Use CLI](/doc/product/440/6317).
