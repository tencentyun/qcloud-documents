1) First, you need to specify the region where your CVM resides.

Tips for region selection:
- The selection should depend on your users' geographical locations. The closer the CVM is to the accessing client, the shorter the access latency and the higher the access speed will be. For example, if most of your users are located near Yangtze River D- Please note that CVMs in different regions cannot communicate with each other via private network but only via public network with a charge, while CVMs in the same region can communicate with each other via private network free of charge.


2) Select the CVM configuration.
The following configurations are recommended for you:
- Entry-level: 1 core; 1GB memory; 1Mbps bandwidth or based on consumed traffic. Suitable for small websites such as personal blogs.
- Basic: 1 core; 2GB memory; 1Mbps bandwidth. Suitable for simple Web applications such as enterprise official websites.
