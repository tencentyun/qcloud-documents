Note

1. CVM tiered pricing program only involves CPU and memory costs, excluding network and disk costs.
2. The tiered pricing program applies only to the same configuration. If the configuration changes, billing will starts again from tier 1 of the new configuration. In the CVM example: the original configuration is 2-core 4 GB and you have entered tier 2 after using it for 100 hours. Then you change the configuration to 1-core 2 GB, so your billing starts again from tier 1 of the 1-core 2 GB configuration.
3. The postpaid arrears program remains unchanged. [Learn about the Arrears Program for Postpaid](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/%E5%88%B0%E6%9C%9F%E6%8F%90%E9%86%92#2.-.E6.8C.89.E9.87.8F.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9.E4.BA.91.E6.9C.8D.E5.8A.A1.E5.99.A8.E5.88.B0.E6.9C.9F.E6.8F.90.E9.86.92)
