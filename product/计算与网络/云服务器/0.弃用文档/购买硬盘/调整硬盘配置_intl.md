 - For postpaid, if and only if both the system disk and data disk use <font color="red">cloud disks</font>, their configuration can be adjusted.
- Only data disks support random configuration adjustment, and system disks only support expansion upon system reinstallation.
- The disk can be expanded only when the CVM on which the disk is mounted is shut down.
- After disk expansion, you need to manually modify the file system configuration before using the newly added capacity.
- For the sake of security, the disk capacity can only be expanded, but not reduced.
