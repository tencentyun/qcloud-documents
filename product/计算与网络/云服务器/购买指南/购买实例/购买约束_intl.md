## Purchase Limits for Prepaid CVM Instances


A fixed quota of Tencent Cloud prepaid CVMs in each availability zone is allocated for each user.
-  For each user in each availability zone, the monthly quota for newly purchased prepaid CVM instances (not net increase) is 150. The quotas in different availability zones are calculated independently.
-  The quota of prepaid CVM instances only includes the quantity of **newly purchased** instances. Existing CVMs and expired CVMs are not included.
-  The quota calculation cycle is one calendar month.
For example:
	The calculation cycle for February 2016: February 1, 00:00:00 - February 29, 23:59:59.
	The calculation cycle for May 2017: May 1, 00:00:00 - May 31, 23:59:59.
- If the number of instances you need to purchase exceeds the quota limit in the corresponding region, you can submit an application for increasing the quota. Tencent Cloud will assess your actual needs and increase your quota as appropriate. The increased quota is valid in the current month and will revert to the original value from the 1st of the next month. 
**How to apply for quota increase:**
[Submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?level1_id=6&level2_id=7&source=0). Select **Application for increasing CVM quota** and select your CVM type. Enter the target region, the target quota and the CVM configuration, and the application reason and problem description based on the actual situation, and your valid phone number, and then click **Submit the Ticket**.
>**Note:**
> - To get a quota for one availability zone or get a unified quota for multiple availability zones, you simply need to select the availability zone(s) and enter the target quota.
> - To get different quotas for multiple availability zones, you need to apply for them separately.
