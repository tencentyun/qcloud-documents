This section demonstrates how to purchase CVMs on the official website and describes some important considerations.
To purchase CVMs, please see CVM purchase guides:
- [Create a Windows CVM](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2764#.E6.AD.A5.E9.AA.A4.E4.BA.8C.EF.BC.9A.E5.88.9B.E5.BB.BA-windows-.E4.BA.91.E6.9C.8D.E5.8A.A1.E5.99.A8)
- [Create a Linux CVM](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2936#.E6.AD.A5.E9.AA.A4.E4.BA.8C.EF.BC.9A.E5.88.9B.E5.BB.BA-linux-.E4.BA.91.E6.9C.8D.E5.8A.A1.E5.99.A8)

## Purchase History
>**Notes:**
>- Purchase history is only available for users who have purchased CVMs.
>- Purchase history of postpaid CVMs is not supported, but it will be available soon.

**Purchase history** displays the **latest 10** purchase records. CVMs with the same configuration can be purchased with one click from the purchase history, which simplifies the purchase path.

**Procedure**
1. Log in to the [CVM product page](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/cvm), and click **Buy Now**.
2. Click **Purchase History** beside the title of the purchase page.

The latest 10 purchase records are displayed in the floating window. You can view the detailed configuration in the corresponding purchase records.
Select the purchase record of the CVM with the configuration you need and click **OK**. The system will automatically select a CVM with the same configuration for you.

You can complete the purchase after configuration verification and simple CVM information setting (purchase quantity, usage period, CVM name, password, and security group).

>**Note:**
> If the configuration or image in the purchase record is unavailable, the configuration verification will fail. Please purchase CVMs with other configurations.

## Set Unified Expiry Date on Purchase Page
**Unified expiry date** supports setting the expiry date of multiple prepaid devices to the same day of each month, allowing you to manage and renew multiple CVMs in batches.

- If you have never used this feature before, the check box for unified expiry date is not displayed on the purchase page.
 For more information, please see [Setting unified expiry date](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/7454#.E8.AE.BE.E7.BD.AE.E7.BB.9F.E4.B8.80.E5.88.B0.E6.9C.9F.E6.97.A5).
- If you have used this feature before, the unified expiry date box is displayed on the purchase page. The purchased usage period of CVMs for which the box is selected should be longer than a month. The fee for a period less than a month is calculated based on the monthly price and the number of days purchased.
 For example, on November 12, you purchase a CVM with the unified expiry date selected. The monthly price is 60 CNY and the unified expiry date is the 20th of each month. This CVM expires on December 20 and you need to pay 76 CNY (60+60รท30ร8).

>**Note:**
> Unified expiry date does not support a duration longer than 9 months.
