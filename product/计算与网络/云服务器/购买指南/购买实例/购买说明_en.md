## Purchase history
Purchase history supports displaying your recent **10** purchase records. With it, you can achieve one-key purchase of the same configuration, to simplify the purchase path. 

- Supports pulling your recent 10 purchase records.
- Select the configuration you want to purchase. After passing the configuring check, go directly to Step 3 of the purchase page and simply configure the CVM settings (purchase quantity, duration, host name, password, security group) to complete the purchase.
- If the configuration/image in purchase history is off shelve, the configuration check fails. Try to purchase another configuration.

>Note: Currently purchase history for postpaid services is not supported. Please look forward to feature upgrades.

## Uniform expiration date on purchase page
Uniform expiration date means that you can set the expiration time of prepaid devices to the same day of each month, to facilitate your uniform management and renewal of CVMs.

- If you have never used the **Uniform expiration date** feature, the purchase page does not display the Uniform expiration date check box.
For the guide on setting a fixed expiration date, click [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/285/1894#.E4.BA.94.E3.80.81.E8.AE.BE.E7.BD.AE.E7.BB.9F.E4.B8.80.E5.88.B0.E6.9C.9F.E6.97.A5)
- If you have set the **Uniform expiration date** feature, the purchase page will display the Uniform expiration date check box. The purchase period for those CVMs with this field checked must be more than one month. For those days less than a full month, we will calculate the fees by converting monthly package into daily billing. For example, on November 12, you buy a CVM and check the Uniform expiration date feature at the prices of 60 CNY/month, and the fixed expiration date is the 20th day of each month. Then the CVM expires on December 20, and you need to pay 76 CNY (60 +60 รท 30 ร 8).

>Note:  Uniform expiration date does not support a purchase period of more than 9 months.
