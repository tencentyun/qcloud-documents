Tencent Cloud allows users to purchase CVMs either from the official website or via the API. This section describes these two purchasing methods in details:

## Purchasing from Official Website

All users can purchase CVMs on [Tencent Cloud official website](http://manage.qcloud.com/shoppingcart/shop.php?tab=cvm). According to different billing methods, users can purchase prepaid CVMs (on a monthly/yearly basis) or postpaid CVMs (billing is accurate to seconds and is settled on an hourly basis). For more information, please see CVM [Billing Methods](/doc/product/213/%E8%AE%A1%E8%B4%B9%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E).
