Cloud resources can be managed by project. When a CVM instance is created, it must be assigned to a project. Tencent Cloud allows re-assigning an instance to a new project.


>**Note:**
>To assign an instance to a new project, create the new project first. For more information, please see [New Project](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/10861).


## Procedure


1. Go to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index), and select the CVM or CVMs to be assigned to the new project.
2. Click **More** (for a single CVM) or **More actions** (for multiple CVMs), and then click **Change Project**.
