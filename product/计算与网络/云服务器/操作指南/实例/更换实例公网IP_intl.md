The public network IP of the instance can be replaced by binding and unbinding the EIP. After the EIP is bound, the original public network IP will be lost and cannot be retrieved. After the EIP is released, a new public IP will be assigned for free to complete the public IP replacement.

> **Note:**
> Release the unbound EIP as soon as possible if you no longer use it. Otherwise, you will be billed for the idle EIP. The released EIP cannot be retrieved. For more information, please see [Billing Method](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/11145).
