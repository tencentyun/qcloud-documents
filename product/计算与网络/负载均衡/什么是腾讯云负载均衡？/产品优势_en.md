The following indicators are used to evaluate the performance of the Cloud Load Balance:

- TPS (CPS): the number of TCP connections per second established by cloud load balancer instance
- Maximum Concurrent TCP Connections: the Concurrent TCP Connections refers to the number of concurrent TCP connections to the server requested by the client, or the total number of TCP connections to the server
- QPS: or RPS, the number of queries/requests per second. The queries/requests refer to the GET/POST/HEAD packets sent by the client to the http server after the establishment of connections
- Throughput: The total traffic/bandwidth that the cloud load balancer instance can support

Tencent Cloud provides high-performance Cloud Load Balance services:

- Strict isolation of traffic for each tenant, providing active DDoS protection. If the service suffers a DDoS attack, Tencent Cloud's Dayu system can defend against a peak traffic above 300 Gb
- Capable of providing over 120 million connections by a single cluster of cloud load balancer, easy to respond to tens of millions of Web visits
- Capable of handling a peak traffic of 40Gb/s by a single cluster of cloud load balancer, with QPS up to 6 million
