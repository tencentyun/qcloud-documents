For more information on types of cloud load balancer instances, refer to [Public Network Cloud Load Balancer](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6147) and [Private Network Cloud Load Balancer](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6148).

If a CLB-associated CVM is isolated (put into the recycle bin, or removed according to the postpaid plan) due to arrears, the CLB still binds this CVM.
