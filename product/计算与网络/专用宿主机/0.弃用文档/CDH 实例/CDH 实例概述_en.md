CDH instance refers to the purchased CDH service on which you can create multiple CVMs as needed.

You can log in to the Console to monitor and manage your CDHs (e.g. to allocate resources).

CDH is available in three models:

**Standard**: **Economical choice. Suitable for most scenarios.

**High I/O**: **Recommended for low latency, I/O-intensive applications.

**MEM optimized**: Suitable for applications that require extensive memory operations, searches and computing.

Based on different underlying hardware, Tencent Cloud offers two series of instances - *Series 1* and *Series 2* (also referred to as *last-generation instance* and *current-generation instance*). They respectively provide the following instance types:

##### **Types of current-generation instances**:

###### Standard HS20, high I/O HI20, MEM-optimized HM20 and computing HC20

Series 2 uses Intel E5-Xeon Broadwell (v4) CPU and DDR4 memory and delivers a better memory computing capacity. Used with network enhanced, this series can achieve a packet forwarding speed of up to 300K pps. The integer and floating-point computing performance increases by 40%, demonstrating a more powerful overall computing capacity.



##### **Types of last-generation instances**

###### Standard HS10, high I/O HI10, and MEM-optimized HM10

Series 1 features Intel Xeon CPU and DDR3 memory.



It is recommended to create an instance using a current-generation instance type so that optimal performance can be achieved.
