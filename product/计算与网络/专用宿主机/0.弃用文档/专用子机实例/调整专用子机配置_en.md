The configurations of dedicated CVM instances can be adjusted easily and quickly, although this is limited by the amount of resources remaining on the host where the CVM resides. Users can make the adjustment as desired to adapt to their business needs at different stages.

- It's possible to adjust the configuration of the dedicated CVM instances both on local/cloud disk drives.
- The hardware configuration can be adjusted only when the instance is shutdown.
- Otherwise, only network configuration can be adjusted.
- Users can only expand the cloud disk bound to a dedicated CVM when the CVM is shutdown.

### Adjust the instance configuration through the CVM console

> 1. Log in to [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm).
> 2. Locate the dedicated CVM instance and shut it down.
> 3. In the right pane, click "More" -> "CVM Settings" -> "Adjust Configuration".
