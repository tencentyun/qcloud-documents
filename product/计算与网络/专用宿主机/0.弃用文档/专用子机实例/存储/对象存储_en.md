The CVM instance described below also refers to dedicated CVM.

Tencent Cloud's Cloud Object Storage (COS) is a data storage device on the Internet and provides users with a fast and reliable data storage solution for a low price. Users can store and retrieve data via any location on CVM instance or the Internet. COS stores user data redundantly across multiple regions and allows multiple clients or application threads to perform read/write operations on those data at the same time. The data on the COS can be retrieved in a similar way to Internet domain names and be accessed by using a HTTP URL address.
