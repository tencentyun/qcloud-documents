The CVM instance described below also refers to dedicated CVM.

Tencent Cloud's Cloud Block Storage (CBS) provides storage at data block level for CVM instances. As a storage medium with high availability and high reliability, Cloud Block Storage comes with a variety of hard types to cater to the diversified needs of users in read/write operations. For more information about Cloud Block Storage, please see [Cloud Block Storage product documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/362).

In case of frequent data changes that require faster read/write speed and persistent storage, you're recommended to use Tencent Cloud's Cloud Block Storage. Cloud storage can be mounted to any running instance in the same availability zone, just like an ordinary mobile hard disk. It is particularly suitable to be used as such application like instance's file system and database storage, with data existing independently of instance's life cycle.
