Dedicated server is a CVM created in the CDH instance. Users can custom its specifications basing on its CDH resources to adapt to different business scenarios. Dedicated CVMs can be managed centrally through their host, and can also be managed as ordinary CVM instances.

* Dedicated CVMs have the same functions as ordinary CVMs, and support related cloud products (such as image, storage, network) available to all ordinary CVMs. Users can adjust the configurations of dedicated CVMs. Network configuration can be adjusted when the CVM is on, while hardware configuration can only be adjusted when the CVM is shutdown.
* Dedicated CVMs provide the same user experiences as ordinary CVM, and support the same operations as those on ordinary CVMs.
