You can terminate a dedicated CVM instance any time you don't need it. When a dedicated CVM instance is terminated, the local disks and non-elastic cloud disks mounted to the instance will be terminated as well and the data stored on these disks will be lost. But the elastic cloud disks mounted to the instance will be retained and the data will not be affected.
