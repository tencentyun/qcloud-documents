## 1. Key Clients from Game Industry

Clients from game industry can purchase multiple hosts, and estimate the duration to use CDH according to business peak hours, before purchasing hosts and creating CVMs. These clients can deploy machines dedicated to new games, and migrate the business to other hosts with inferior performance after peak hours are over. They can also merge the game servers. Place applications with stable conditions onto one standalone host and place free resources onto another. Terminate the idle host upon expiration or use it to serve new games.

Game industry clients can also contact key client managers or submit tickets to customize their hosts, by possessing exclusive hosts.
