Different from Tencent Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM), Tencent Cloud CVM Dedicated Host (CDH) provides exclusive physical server resources to users. It's a supplement to our CVM service designed to satisfy user demands regarding dedicated resource, physical resource isolation, security and regulatory compliance. Users can purchase and manage resources that belong to their own dedicated host. After purchase, users can create free CVM instances with customized specification and quantity on their CDHs.

Dedicated CVMs inherit the major features and characteristics of ordinary CVMs.

There are two notions about CDH:

- Dedicated CVM: dedicated CMV instances created by users on CDHs.
- CDH instance/CDH: CVM dedicated host purchased by users.
