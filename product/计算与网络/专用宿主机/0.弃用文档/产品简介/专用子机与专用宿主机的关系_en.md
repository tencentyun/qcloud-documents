A CDH is a physical server dedicated to a single user. After purchase, you need to create dedicated CVMs on your CDH to start using (we already deployed virtual system on CDH).

Dedicated CVMs are virtual machines user created by using pre-deployed virtual system and CDH physical resources. A dedicated CVM is equivalent to a CVM instance. Creating dedicated CVMs on a CDH is basically dividing and allocating the resources of a physical server to multiple virtual machines.
