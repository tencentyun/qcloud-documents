## 1. Exclusive Resources

By purchasing CDHs, you can enjoy dedicated host resources and keep your resources physically isolated from other users. You can manage the resources within your CDH on your free will, while avoiding resource conflict with other tenants.



## 2. Flexible Creation

In the CDH console, you can freely create dedicated CVMs with specifications of your choice on specified CDH. Dedicated CVMs are not restricted by the limitations for ordinary CVM instances. You can easily view the resource allocation and usage of CDH, as well as manage the specifications based on CDH resources and your own demands. You can adjust the configuration of dedicated CVM instances, adjust network at any time without shutting down the CVM, and adjust hardware configuration when CVM is shut down.



## 3. Security Compliance

Resources are physically isolated between hosts, CPU, memory, disk and network resources are all dedicated to a single user.

Physical machine level resource isolation provides sensitive business data protection and disk erasure features to meet the strict compliance requirements in the financial industry.



## 4. Management and Monitor

Tencent Cloud supports multi-dimensional monitor and management for CDHs and dedicated CVMs, as well as free Cloud Monitor service and multiple types of real-time alert features.



## 5. Asset-Light
