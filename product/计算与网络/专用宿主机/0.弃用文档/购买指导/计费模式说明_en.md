## 1. CDH billing mode

CDH service is available in prepaid mode.

You can make a prepayment for services for one or more months or years. We offer a discount that if you purchase one year of usage period at a time, you only need to pay the charges for 10 months. The charges accrue linearly with CPU, memory and disk resources.
