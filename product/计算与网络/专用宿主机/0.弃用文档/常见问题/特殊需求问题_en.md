### 1. Can I migrate CVMs on CDHs?

You can migrate CVM instances between CDHs with the same model and configurations. Please apply for this operation with a ticket when needed.
But you CANNOT migrate CVMs between CDH resource pools and ordinary CVM instance resource pools.

### 2. Can I upgrade my CDHs?

No. CDHs are physical-machine level resources and their hardware configurations can't be changed after purchase. Please evaluate your requirements carefully before purchasing CDHs.

However, you can adjust the configurations of CVM instances on CDHs. For more information, please see [here>]().
