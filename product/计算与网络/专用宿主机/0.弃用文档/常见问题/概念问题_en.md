### 1. What is the difference between a CVM Dedicated Host (CDH) and a CPM?

CDHs are virtual cloud servers, while CPMs use "bare metal" architecture.
CPM enables physical server rental service on a pay-on-demand and pay-per-use basis.
CDH allows you to buy and create CVMs on a dedicated host.

### 2. What is the difference between a CVM Dedicated Host (CDH) and an ordinary CVM?

The major differences are billing model and performance:

- Different billing models: CDH service charges by the number of host machines, on which multiple CVM instances can be created. Ordinary CVM service charges by the number of CVM instances.
- Different performances: For CDH, all CPU, memory, network and storage resources are dedicated to one single user. While for CVM, multiple users shares resources on one physical server.
