Users who activate SCF are entitled to a certain quota of free resources and calls each month. Public network outbound traffic has no free quota.

The free quota in each month cannot be accumulated and will reset at the beginning of the next month.

When we charge the monthly fees for use of resources and calls, the free quota is deducted, and the rest is charged on a postpaid basis.

| Resource Type | Monthly Free Quota |
| ---- | ------ |
| Resource usage | 400,000 GBs |
| Number of calls | 1 million |
