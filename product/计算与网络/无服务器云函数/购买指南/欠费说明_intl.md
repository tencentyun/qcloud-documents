## Billing Cycle

SCF is billed by usage on a monthly postpaid basis. The bill for the current month is issued on the 3rd to 5th day of the next month.

## Rules for Suspense of Service

If your account becomes negative after settlement on the 3rd to 5th day of each month, you will receive an email and SMS message reminding you to pay off the overdraft. If you fail to pay off the overdraft on the next day of settlement, you will be unable to call SCF. You can create, modify, or configure a trigger for SCF, but you cannot run SCF. If you do so, a message indicating service charge arrears appears.
