This chapter provides some examples for users who use Serverless Cloud Function (SCF) for the first time. You can perform the following operations according to this tutorial:

- Create and test simple Hello World function.
- By configuring the action of uploading files to COS as a trigger, create and test a function: When a file is uploaded to COS Bucket, the file is downloaded to the file system of the environment.

With these two examples, users can perform some operations in the SCF console, including:

- Use templates. Each template provides sample codes and code configurations to implement certain logics. You only need to choose a required template to easily create a SCF that comes with sample codes. "Hello World" primary practice uses the `Hello World` template. "Download File" primary practice uses the `COS Put Object` template.
- Create and update the configuration information of SCF.
- Call the SCF manually and check the function execution result.

After reading "Getting Started", you can also read documents such as "How Does SCF Work?" and "Creating SCF" for more information about how to use SCF to create a production system.
