This chapter provides some examples for users who use Serverless Cloud Function (SCF) for the first time. You can perform the following operations according to this tutorial:

- Create and test simple Hello World function.
- By configuring the action of uploading file to COS as a trigger, create and test a function: When a file is uploaded to COS Bucket, download the file to the file system of environment.

With these two examples, users can perform some operations in SCF console, including:

- Use templates. Each template provides sample code and code configuration to implement certain logics. You only need to choose required template to easily create cloud function that comes with sample code. "Hello World" primary practice uses `Hello World` template. "Download File" primary practice uses `COS Put Object` template.
- Create and update the configuration information of cloud function.
- Call the cloud function manually and check the function execution result.

After reading "Getting Started", you can also read documents such as "How does cloud function work" and "Create SCF" for details about how to use cloud function to create a production system.
