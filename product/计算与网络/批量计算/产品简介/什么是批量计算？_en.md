## What is Batch?
BatchCompute (Batch in short) is a distributed computing platform used to handle massive batch processing jobs. It is designed to provide cost-effective and easy-to-use computing services for enterprises and R&D institutions that require big data computing. Batch can intelligently allocate resources for batch processing jobs at any scales and manage these jobs in their execution, allowing you to focus on analyzing and processing data. Batch is suitable for fields such as gene sequencing, medical analysis, scientific research, video rendering, financial big data, targeted advertising.

As a completely secure hosted service, Batch enables developers, scientists and engineers to run batch processing jobs at any scales. By using Batch, you only need to provide an environment for computing implementation, commands and the storage path for input/output data. Batch can obtain Tencent Cloud's flexible resources based on the workload, and automatically schedule the job execution process to complete thousands of batch processing jobs. Batch can help reduce the operation complexity, save time and minimize cost, to allow developers, scientists and engineers to easily run their batch processing jobs in Tencent Cloud, relieving enterprises and R&D institutions of the need to make a huge up-front investment in building a batch processing data center.
