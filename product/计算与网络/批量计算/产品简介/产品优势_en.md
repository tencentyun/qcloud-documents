| Advantage | Tencent Cloud Batch | Self-built Computing Cluster |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Low cost** | **No upfront investment**<br>You can call massive CVM resources as needed for free to serve Batch. Only the used CVMs are charged.<br>In addition, you don't need to worry about the construction and maintenance of infrastructure, saving cost and time. | **High construction cost**<br>The cost of a self-built infrastructure, purchased or rent for a long time, is high. The construction of a large computing cluster costs at least 10 million CNY.<br>The construction of a computing cluster is a cumbersome and lengthy process. The unknown costs and risks make it hard to focus on your business.  |
| **Flexible resource**| **Resources are scaled on demand**<br>Batch is used based on your needs. You can obtain the desired resources through Batch when you have a computing job. | **Computing capacity is excessive or insufficient**<br>No matter how careful you are to configure the size of a self-built resource cluster, the problem of excessive or insufficient capacity is unavoidable in face of unpredictable business requirements. The cost audit risk caused by resource idleness and slow development of business due to inadequate resources are the issues that we always need to deal with when creating self-built clusters. |
| **Intelligent scheduling** | **Fully managed**<br>Batch can take full control of the most troublesome resource scheduling and process scheduling in batch processing computing. All you need to do is to define and submit the computing jobs, and focus on the analyzing results and solving problem. | **Manual support is required**<br>Manually executing or developing a scheduling software to help execute resource allocation and process scheduling is complex and error-prone. Especially in scenarios with massive resources and computing jobs, the investment in both manpower and resources is often unpredictable. <br> |
| **Powerful and user-friendly** | **A variety of easy-to-use features**<br>Batch provides many auxiliary features, to help you define and submit your computing jobs, such as definition of execution methods, computing process choreography, and status monitoring. All common features for batch processing tasks can be found in Batch. <br>In addition, it is deeply integrated with other cloud services, such as COS. Batch provides one-stop closed-loop service including three major processes: acquisition of computing material, submission and execution of computing job, upload of computing result. | **Self-developed or third-party tools**<br>Self-developing a system for massive batch processing involves too much work and is irrelevant with your main businesses. Most third-party tools are lack of timely technical support and require you to find out how to use it yourself. Both methods can distract you from your main businesses. |
