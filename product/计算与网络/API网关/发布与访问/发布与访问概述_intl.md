A created and configured API can be accessed only after it is published. Otherwise, it can only be used for internal trial. After an API is published, its public network access address will be generated. A user can access it via the bound user domain name.

Service is the basic unit for publishing. In each publishing, all the APIs in the service will be published to the specified environment and can be accessed from the public network. Three environments are supported: testing, pre-publishing and publishing.
