API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale. You can use API Gateway to encapsulate various backend services and make them available in the form of APIs. API Gateway also helps you with API document management, API testing, SDK generation and so on.
