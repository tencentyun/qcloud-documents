## Simplified Management

The APIs are managed at a single place throughout their lifecycle from creation, to maintenance, and to publishing. API Gateway allows you to centrally encapsulate and manage SCFs, Web services on CVMs or users' own Web services.

## Usage-based Billing

You pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out. The API management, document maintenance, SDK generation, traffic control and permission control are free of charge.

## High Performance and Reliability

Built on the powerful capabilities of TGW (Tencent Gateway), API Gateway provides highly-reliable services based on multi-regional multi-server distributed clusters to handle all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls.

## High Security

Ensures security of API calls by using various authentication methods; prevents overload of your services through strict traffic throttling; and ensures the availability of your services relying on comprehensive monitoring and alarming mechanism.
