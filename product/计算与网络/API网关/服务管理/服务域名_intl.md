After a service is created, the sub-domain name, which is used to access the service, can be obtained from the service details. The sub-domain name of the service contains information of the region, user ID and service name, with the format `http://{your-unique-id}.{region}.apigateway.myqcloud.com`. The API gateway service has also enabled the SSL certificate of wildcard domain name, so the sub-domain name of the service can be accessed through the HTTPS protocol. The access address is as follows: `https://{your-unique-id}.{region}.apigateway.myqcloud.com`

Examples:

    service-rnkc5qj2-251000691.ap-guangzhou.apigateway.myqloud.com
