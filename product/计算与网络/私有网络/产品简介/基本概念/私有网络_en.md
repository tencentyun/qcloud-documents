Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) refers to a user-defined network space that is logically isolated from other networks. VPC allows you to freely perform network segmentation, customize private IPs, create routing rules and policies, and control the network access.

VPC is region-sensitive, and you can deploy subnets belonging to multiple availability zones within a VPC.
