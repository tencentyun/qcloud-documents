Either of the two sides can delete the peering connection at any time. The peering connection becomes invalid immediately after being deleted.

When the peering connection is deleted, the routing entry containing this connection in the routing table will also be deleted.

1) Log in to [Cloud Virtual Machine Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click "Virtual Private Cloud" in the navigation bar, select the "Peering Connections" tab in the VPC console to view the established peering connection in the peering connection list, and click "Delete" on the operation column.

2) After you confirm the deletion action, the peering connection is deleted.
