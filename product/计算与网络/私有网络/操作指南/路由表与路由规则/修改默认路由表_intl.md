When the VPC is created, the system will automatically create a default routing table with which the new subnets will be associated by default.

Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click **Virtual Private Cloud** in the navigation bar, click **Routing Tables** tab on the left, then click the ID of the default routing table to enter the routing table details page. Click **Edit** next to the routing rule to modify the default routing rules.

Click **New Line** to create a new routing rule. Enter the destination network segment, select the next hop type (public network gateway, VPN gateway and Direct Connect gateway), and select the next hop gateway name. The rule will take effect immediately after you click **OK** to save it.

You can delete the routing rule by clicking ![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/img569da06880706.png) button and **OK**.
