In addition to the default routing table automatically generated by the system, you can customize a new routing table.

Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click **Virtual Private Cloud** in the navigation bar, click the **Routing Tables** on the left, then click **New** on the top of the list. Then enter the name, network and new routing rule in the pop-up box to customize the routing table.
