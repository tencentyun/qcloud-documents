1) Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.qcloud.com/), click "Virtual Private Cloud" tab on the top bar, and select "Security"-"Network ACL" tabs on the left.

2. Click the "Delete" button at the end of the network ACL to be deleted, and click "OK" in the pop-up box to confirm the deletion. The network ACL and all of its rules will be deleted.

3. If the "Delete" button is grayed out, it indicates that the network ACL is being associated with a subnet. You need to deassociate them before the deletion.
