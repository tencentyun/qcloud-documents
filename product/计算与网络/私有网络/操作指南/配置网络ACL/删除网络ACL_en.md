1) Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click **Virtual Private Cloud** tab on the top bar, and select **Security - Network ACL** on the left.

2. Click **Delete** button at the end of the network ACL to be deleted, and click **OK** in the pop-up box to confirm the deletion. The network ACL and all of its rules will be deleted.

3. If the **Delete** button is grayed out, it indicates that the network ACL is being associated with a subnet. You need to deassociate them before the deletion.
