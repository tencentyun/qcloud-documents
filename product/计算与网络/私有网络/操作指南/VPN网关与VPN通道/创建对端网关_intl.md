Before creating a VPN tunnel, you need to create a customer gateway on the secondary page of customer gateway.

Log in to [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click **Virtual Private Cloud** in the navigation bar, select **VPN Connection - Customer Gateway** tab in the VPC console, and click **New** to create a VPN gateway.

You can create a VPN tunnel during or after the creation of a customer gateway.
