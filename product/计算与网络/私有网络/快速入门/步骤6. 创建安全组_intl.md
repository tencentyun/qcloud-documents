2) Click "Security Groups" in the left navigation pane.
3) Click "New" button, enter the name of the Security Group (e.g. my-security-group) and provide a description to complete the creation.
4) Click "Bind an instance" button at the end of the line for the security group in the list, and select the CVM you just created.
5) Click "Inbound rule" and "Outbound rule" tabs on the top to edit inbound and outbound rules for traffic control.
