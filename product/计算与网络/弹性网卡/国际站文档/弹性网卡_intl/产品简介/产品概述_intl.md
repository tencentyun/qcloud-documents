ENI is a virtual network interface. You can bind an ENI to a CVM for connection to network. It is very useful for configuring management networks and establishing highly reliable network solutions.

An ENI is VPC, availability zone and subnet-specific, and can only be bound to a CVM that resides in the same availability zone as it. A CVM can be bound with multiple ENIs. The maximum number of ENIs allowed to be bound to a CVM depends on the CVM's specification.
