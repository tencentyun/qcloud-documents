Each subnet needs to be associated with a routing table, which is used to specify the outbound route of subnet. You can change the routing table associated with a real-time subnet, or change the routing table content.

Log in to [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click "Virtual Private Cloud" in the navigation bar, then select "Subnets" tab in VPC console, and click ![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/img569d9edf77e97.png) button to select the routing table associated with the subnet.

For more information on how to modify routing rules in the associated routing table, refer to [Modify Default Routing Table](http://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E9%BB%98%E8%AE%A4%E8%B7%AF%E7%94%B1%E8%A1%A8).
