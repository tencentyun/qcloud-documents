The following should be keep in mind when you use Flow Logs:
- Flow Logs service is only supported for the ENIs in VPCs and is not supported for basic network-based CVMs, databases, gateways, peering connections and other services.
- You cannot change the configuration of a flow log (for example, modify the cloud log service that the flow log is shipped to) after it is created. But you can delete the flow log and create a new flow log with the required configuration.
- Not all types of IP traffic will be captured by flow logs. The following types of traffic will not be recorded:
 - The traffic that is generated by Windows instance for activation of Windows license.
 - DHCP traffic.
