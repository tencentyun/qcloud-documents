When you have created a VPC and divided it into subnets, you can add cloud services to the VPC.

You must have an available VPC to see the VPC in the purchase page of cloud resources when you log in to the Tencent Cloud website.

or:
Log in to [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click "Virtual Private Cloud" in the navigation bar, and click the ![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/img568e1e92896dc.png) button in the CVM operation column in the VPC entry for which a CVM needs to be added. This will direct you to the CVM purchase page.

You just need to choose the network and corresponding subnet. Other purchase procedures are same as the ones for the products in basic network. The resource is added to the selected VPC after the purchase.

> Note: Please make sure to reserve sufficient private IPs in the subnet, otherwise the resources cannot be successfully allocated.
