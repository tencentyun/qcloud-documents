#### **Device Bandwidth Package**
Only one BWP can be activated in one region (billed based on either the top 5 peaks or the 95th monthly peak).
After the BWP is activated, all CVMs and LBs in the region will be automatically billed by the BWP;
The BWP billing method cannot coexist with other billing methods in the same region;
The bandwidth fees already paid will be refunded after conversion based on hourly bandwidth.
#### **IP Bandwidth Package**
Only accounts with bandwidth upshift are supported; customers that haven't been upshifted can submit tickets to set the account for bandwidth upshift;
Up to 20 BWPs can be activated in one single region;
The BWP billing method can coexist with other billing methods such as prepaid bandwidth, hourly bandwidth and traffic in the same region;
When adding IP to BWP, you cannot add an IP of prepaid bandwidth;
For the time being, only EIP can be added to BWP. Public IPs have to be converted to EIPs before they can be added to BWP (public IPs will be directly supported soon). You can do so in [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
