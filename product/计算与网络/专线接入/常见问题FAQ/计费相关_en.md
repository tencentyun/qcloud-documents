- If you do not top up for the renewal of suspended Direct Connect within 1 month, the Direct Connect enters into the termination process. The Direct Connect and corresponding Direct Connect tunnels are deleted.
- You need to notify us whether to continue the use of Direct Connect service by email, which serves as the basis for reference.
