You can change the interconnection IP and peer IP address range. If you need to change the VLANID of a Direct Connect tunnel, delete the existing tunnel and re-create one.
You cannot submit the ticket for change of the Direct Connect tunnel to the Direct Connect manager offline. Submit your change requirement in the console.
