You can reject the peering connection request you receives with a status of "To be Accepted". Except for the accounts you trust, you can reject any unnecessary requests.

1) Log in to [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), click "Virtual Private Cloud" in the navigation bar, select the "Peering Connections" tab in the VPC console to view the peering connection to be accepted in the peering connection list, and click "Reject" button on the operation column.

2) The peering connection has been rejected and disappears.
