TTS provides a variety of tone options and allows you to customize volume and speed. It provides enterprise customers with custom vocabulary and personalized speaker services to make pronunciation more natural, professional and suitable to scenarios. TTS is widely used in voice navigation, audiobooks, reading with standard pronunciation, automatic news broadcast and other scenarios.
## Advantages
1. Leading algorithm
The TTS system developed by Tencent based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) adopts the advanced deep learning synthesis algorithm in the industry, featuring fast synthesis speed as well as natural and fluent synthesized speech. It makes machines and applications "speak" easily, and achieves human-machine interaction in a more smooth and efficient manner.
2. High stability
With a massive user base, the service is proven to be stable and efficient, and better matches business scenarios. It provides service to such products as WeChat, map.qq.com, fm.qq.com, tianqi.2345.com with 100 million DAUs.
## Product Features
It supports synthesis in Chinese, English, bilingual and other languages. Properties such as volume and speed can be configured based on business needs, and more options of human voices are available. The rich emotional corpora and the speech synthesis engine that applies advanced machine learning algorithm in industry make the synthesized speech more natural and close to human reading level.
## Common Scenarios
**Intelligent Customer Service Robot**
Intelligent customer service robot automatically recognizes customer's phonetics and semantics, and automatically responds to customers' questions with voice through TTS, to create a closed loop for human-machine interaction.

**Electronic Audio Books**
With audiobooks, people can enjoy learning while driving, walking or at a moment when it is not convenient to read. Manual synthesis of audiobooks takes time and effort, and the accuracy cannot be ensured. TTS makes it easier to create audiobooks. With emotion synthesis technology, voice becomes more natural and pleasant. Custom speaker feature supports personalized voices to meet various business needs.

**Smart Education**
In combination with the smart education system, TTS can achieve standard reading and guided reading of English/Chinese phonemes, words, phrases and texts. In addition to the public basic education-based classes, TTS is widely used in extra-class education and training institutions and teaching auxiliary software.
