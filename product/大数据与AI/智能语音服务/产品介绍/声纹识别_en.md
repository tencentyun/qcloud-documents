Voiceprint Recognition (VPR) performs identification based on the speaker's acoustic characteristics, and can be used for speaker recognition and validation. Accent and language do not affect the identification.
## Advantages
a. High stability
With a massive user base, the service is proven to be stable and reliable, and can expand along with the business. It has been applied in WeChat voice lock, WeBank remote account opening, and other scenarios, serving more than 100 million users.
b. High security
Voiceprint characteristics and speech are verified at the same time, which provides a two-factor verification for enhanced security and reliability. Voiceprint verification with random numbers or text can determine whether the playback unit is a counterfeit recording.
## Number-based Password Recognition
You no longer need to memorize the "digital password" for authentication. Instead, you only need to read out rather than inputting the digital password automatically assigned by the system to complete authentication. This feature eliminates the problem of forgotten or confused passwords and provides fast and secure authentication in real time.
## Text-based Password Recognition
During registration, you need to read out a specified text and keep the text password in mind. The system verifies the specified text and voiceprint characteristics at the same time for authentication. You need to keep the text password well and confidential. Besides, you can either use a text password automatically assigned by the system or customize one as needed, which is very flexible and convenient.
## Speaker Identification
Before speaker identification, you need to provide a target speaker set that includes all users' voice characteristics sequences. It is a multiple choice question to identify the speaker by recognizing his/her voice from the speaker set.
