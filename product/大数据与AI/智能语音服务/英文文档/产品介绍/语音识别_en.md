Featuring the most advanced learning algorithm in the industry, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) provides excellent capabilities of voice-to-text, keyword search, mute detection, speed detection, and emotion recognition. It completely meets the voice processing needs in scenarios of telephone recording quality control, real-time voice input, LVB subtitles and review.
## Advantages
**Powerful recognition capability:** Based on Tencent social data platform, ASR accumulates more than 100 thousand hours of annotation voice data, possesses massive language-layer data, and provides competitive recognition accuracy.
**A complete set of solutions:** ASS adopts industry-leading speech recognition modeling methods including LSTM, BLSTM, Deep CNN, LFMMI, CTC revaluation and other acoustic modeling techniques.
**Wide application:** ASR has been fully verified in major internal and external business lines, including zhenai.com, zhihu.com, Beijing Intellectual Property Court, WeChat and QQ. It covers a wide range of industries, serves 100 million DAUs, and applies to a rich variety of business scenarios.
## Speech to Text
Speech-to-text feature can convert speech into text. Speech input device can be a phone, mobile phone, gooseneck microphone, or microphone array. In addition, you can specify a generic or specific field engine based on your business needs. It is widely used in scenarios such as transcription of telephone records, input of electronic medical records, synchronization of subtitles for conferences, and adding subtitles in LVBs.
## Keyword Search
Keyword search feature can help you search the business-focused words from your voice files. You can submit a maximum of 200 keywords at a time. With this feature, you can locate keywords in a piece of speech, and determine their time offset from the beginning of the speech, and also obtain confidence level of the result. It is widely used in telephone recording, LVB, and APP audio quality check.
## Speed Detection
Speed detection feature can detect the speed of speech, and gives the number of words spoken in a minute. Compared to manual detection, it is more accurate and efficient with lower cost. This feature is widely used in scenarios such as telephone speed monitoring, speed monitoring in the simultaneous interpretation scenario, speed evaluation for television and broadcast announcers.
