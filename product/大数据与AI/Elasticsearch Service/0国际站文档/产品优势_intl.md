ES provides a highly available, scalable and easily maintained cloud-hosted Elasticsearch cluster service.

### Elastic deployment
A variety of node instance specifications are provided to meet your needs in all kinds of scenarios. You can select an appropriate model based on the volume of data and queries, and customize the storage capacity of nodes to minimize wasteful costs caused by resource idleness. As your data volumes increase with business growth, clusters can be dynamically scaled to meet ever-changing business needs.

### Ease of use
An ES cluster can be created in just minutes through a simple configuration process, eliminating the need for deploying and debugging hardware and software. ES also provides convenient cluster OPS tools (via Kibana pages) and a comprehensive cluster monitoring and alarming system to meet your daily cluster OPS needs.

### Openness
ES supports the complete ELK ecosystem, covering the entire lifecycle from data collection to storage and consumption. It supports various open source plug-ins and RESTful APIs, allowing you to select appropriate plug-ins and clients and build your own applications on ES clusters.

### High availability
ES adopts a multi-node and multi-replica deployment scheme which intelligently detects and replaces faulty nodes, reducing the risk of data loss caused by failures and ensuring data security and service stability.

### Security
ES is deployed on logically isolated VPCs, enabling you to configure your VPC environment and customize network access control lists and security groups. Further, access from browser to Kibana can be controlled via the blacklist and whitelist of IPs, systematically protecting the security of your cloud resources.

### Service integration
ES can be easily integrated with other products of Tencent Cloud such as COS, Flow Logs, Message Queue and CDB to provide you with various data capabilities like data transfer and backup for different usage scenarios.
