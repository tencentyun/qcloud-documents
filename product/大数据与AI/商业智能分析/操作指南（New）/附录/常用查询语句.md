## 基础语句

| 语句     | 举例                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All      | SELECT * from test_cloud.clqry                               |
| Where    | SELECT Market_Size, Sales from test_cloud.clqry where Market_Size ="Major Market" |
| Group by | SELECT Market, Sum(Sales) as Sum_Sales from test_cloud.clqry group by Market |
| Order by | SELECT Market, Sales from test_cloud.clqry order by Sales DESC |
| SubQuery | SELECT Id_O as M_ID FROM Orders.eqry WHERE M_ID = (SELECT domestic_price FROM CustomOilQry.cqry WHERE domestic_price=3 SELECT ID FROM CoffeeQryScript.scqry where ID > (SELECT ID as S_ID FROM CoffeeQrySQL.sqry WHERE S_ID = 4245)) |
| Alias    | SELECT Market as "Market1", Sum(Sales) as Sum_Sales from test_cloud.clqry group by Market SELECT Market as shichang from test_cloud.clqry |

## 过滤条件

| 函数             | 举例                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Like           | SELECT Market from test_cloud.clqry where Market like '%a%'  |
| Sub Query not in | SELECT domestic_price as M_ID ,global_price FROM CustomOilQry.cqry where M_ID NOT IN (SELECT ID as S_ID FROM CoffeeQrySQL.sqry WHERE S_ID>3) |
| Between    | SELECT ID from test_cloud.clqry where ID between 2 and 10    |
| ContainsIn       | “=”, "!=", "<>", ">", ">=", "<", "<="                        |
| Join             | SELECT * from "a.eqry" A inner join "b.eqry" B on A.key=B.keySELECT * from "a.eqry" A full join "b.eqry" B on A.key=B.keySELECT * from "a.eqry" A right join "b.eqry" B on A.key=B.keySELECT * from "a.eqry" A left join "b.eqry" B on A.key=B.key |
| Union            | SELECT ID1 from "a.eqry" A union select ID2 from "b.eqry"    |

## 算数计算 

示例如下：
```
SELECT State as state_a, Product, sum(ID) + 2 as tp from coffee.sqry group by state_a, Product order by tpSELECT Sales * 2 + 3 from test_cloud.clqry
```

## 日期函数

| 函数                                        | 举例                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, minute, second        | SELECT "Date", year("Date"), quarter("Date"), month("Date"), week("Date"), day("Date"), hour("Date"), minute("Date"), second("Date") from test_cloud.clqry |
| Datepart: quarterpart, monthpart, weekpart, daypart, hourpart, minutepart, secondpart | SELECT "Date", quarterpart("Date"), monthpart("Date"), weekpart("Date"), daypart("Date"), hourpart("Date"), minutepart("Date"), secondpart("Date") from test_cloud.clqry |

## GIS 函数

InCircle 用来返回指定经纬度，半径（单位：米）以内满足条件的点；InRect 用来返回指定中心点，宽和高（单位：米）以内满足条件的点。

| 函数     | 举例                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| InCircle | SELECT longitude,latitude from "gis/gis_cloud.clqry" where pos1 incircle(6.0, 5.1, 1000000) order by longitude, latitude asc |
| InRect   | SELECT longitude,latitude from "gis/gis_cloud.clqry" where pos1 inrect(-15, 4.1, 2226388, 2226388) order by longitude, latitude asc |
