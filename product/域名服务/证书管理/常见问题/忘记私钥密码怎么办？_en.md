If you forget the private key password, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?level1_id=1&level2_id=320&level1_name=%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E7%B1%BB%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98&level2_name=SSL%E8%AF%81%E4%B9%A6), and select **Other problems** to ask Tencent Cloud engineers to delete the certificate, and then re-apply for a certificate for the domain name.
