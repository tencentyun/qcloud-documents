According to the identity verification requirement announced by MIIT in 2017, all stock of domain names and newly registered domain names are required to complete identity verification. For now, involved domain names include: .com/.net/.cn/.xyz/.club/.wang/.mobi/.info/.中国/.在线/.中文网. If identity verification is not completed within a specified period of time, the registry will suspend the resolution for your domain name (Serverhold) which means the domain name cannot be accessed. It will be resumed once identity verification is finished. Thus, make sure to complete the verification when you register a new domain name.

>**Note:**
>1. Starting from July 18th, 2016, .com/.net domain names must complete identity verification within 5 days after registration, or they will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be used. Once identity verification is completed, the domain name will be resumed to OK status in 1-2 work days.
>2. Starting from January 6th, 2017, .xyz/.club/.wang/.info/.mobi domain names must complete identity verification within 5 days after registration, or they will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be used.
>3. All .com/.net domain names that were registered before July 18th, 2016 must complete identity verification.
>4. All .cn/.com.cn/.net.cn/.ac.cn/.中国 domestic domain names must complete identity verification within 5 days after registration, or they will be locked and cannot be used. Once identity verification is completed, the domain name will be resumed in 1-2 work days.

## Steps for Identity Verification
Once a domain name is registered, "Identity Verification Not Completed" will appear in the console which means verification is required for the domain name. There are two types of identity verification: individual verification and enterprise verification. The two approaches require different information.
### Individual Verification
If you entered "individual" as user information upon registering your domain name, you need to enter individual information to complete individual identity verification. The steps are as follows:
**Step 1: Go to the Domain Name Management Page**
Open the [Tencent Cloud Official Website](https://cloud.tencent.com/) and click "Console" on the right of the top navigation bar to log in to the console home page.

**Step 2: Submit Materials for Verification**
Choose the domain name for which identity verification is to be completed and click "Identity Verification Not Completed" under the corresponding **Domain Name Status** bar to jump to the identity verification page.
In the identity verification page, confirm the domain name information first. If the information was entered during registration and you want to modify the information, click "Edit".
Next, submit the materials for domain name verification: enter your ID card number and upload the scanned copy of your frontal ID card (**note:** to improve accuracy and speed of the verification process, it is recommended to submit scanned copy of your ID card instead of unclear pictures taken by a camera), then click "Submit".
>**Note**
>For identity verification for .com, .net, .cn, .xyz, .club, .wang, .中国 domain names, the submitted ID card must match with the identity of the domain name owner.

>**Note:** After the administration department put "integration of three certificates" (business license, organization code certificate, and taxation registration certificate) into practice, the certificates for certain enterprises are now Unified Social Credit Codes. If you chose "Business License" as verification method, enter the complete and correct social credit code; if you chose "Organization Code Certificate", enter the correct social credit code starting from the 9th digit till the second to last digit.
