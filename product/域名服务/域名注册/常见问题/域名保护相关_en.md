### Notes About Domain Name Protection
- Information such as domain name contact's mobile phone and email can be protected for domain names that already passed identity verification (identity verification is required for these domain names: .com/.net/.cn/.xyz/.club/.wang/.mobi/.info/.中国/.在线/.中文网). But the information of domain name owner is not protected;
- When domain name protection is enabled (when domain name is under protection), domain name owner and information cannot be changed. Disable the feature first if you need to change them.
