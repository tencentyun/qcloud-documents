### Notes for Changing Domain Name Owner
Note:
Changing domain name owner means to transfer ownership of the domain name to another person. Perform this action with caution.
Notes:
1. If the domain name is registered before July 18th, 2016 that does not need identity verification for now, or the domain name whose identity is not verified or not being verified, the domain name owner can be modified.
2. The domain name owner owns the domain name. Should you lost your account and need to retrieve your purchased domain name, you can submit a ticket for technical assistance. You also need to provide the following certificates:
- Individual user: personal ID number and the scanned copy of your frontal ID card;
- Enterprise user: scanned copy of your business license or organization code certificate.

### Can I Change Domain Name Information if Identity Verification is Completed?
You can still change domain name information if identity verification is completed. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Domain Name Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/domain/mydomain), find the domain name to be modified and click "Manage" -> "Domain Name Profile", then click "Edit" at "Domain Name Owner (Chinese)" and "Domain Name Owner (English)", enter the new information, and save your changes.
