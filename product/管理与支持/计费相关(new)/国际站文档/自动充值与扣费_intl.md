# Why do we automatically charge and top up your account?
Most of our cloud services are billed by the hour and therefore your account will be automatically charged by the hour. When your account balance runs negative, it is very likely that your cloud services will be interrupted. We strongly suggest that you top up before purchasing any services. To make sure you have a better experience with our cloud services, we will automatically top up your Tencent Cloud account when your account balance runs less than $1. If the top up amount is larger than the amount you currently owe, it will be reduced automatically the next time you are charged. 

# How does automatic charge and top up work?
The timing of when we automatically charge your account depends on the cloud services you use. Most of our cloud services are billed by the hour, meaning your account will be automatically charged by the hour. If your account balance is less than $1, we will automatically top up your account until your account balance is $30.  

For example, if your account balance is $2 and you spent $3 on services in the recent billing cycle, we will charge you $3 and top up your account balance to $30 automatically. If your account balance is $3.5 and you spent $3 on services in the recent billing cycle, we will top up your account balance to $29.5 automatically. In either case, your account balance will be $30.

If the automatic charge fails and your account balance remains negative, cloud services for most products will be interrupted within two hours. Please ensure that your PayPal is valid and functioning.



# How to withdraw money from your balance?
If the top up amount is larger than the amount you currently owe and you do not intend to use our services in the future, you can submit a ticket in the console to withdraw the remaining balance. The withdrawn amount will return to your original payment source, which will be your PayPal account in most cases. It will normally take about 3-5 work days for the withdrawal process to complete. 

Please note that only cash balance can be withdrawn, credit balance (free credits or service credits granted by Tencent Cloud) cannot be withdrawn.
