## What is a resource statement?

The resource statement reflects the corresponding resource details of the monthly deductions of your account.


   Postpaid resources that charges on monthly basis: the resources that charges on a monthly basis is used in the last month; the resources that charges on a daily basis is used from the last day of the last month to the last but one day of this month; the resources that charges on an hourly basis is used from the last hour of the last month to the last but one hour of this month.

Example:

Prepaid resources purchased each month

- The resource statement of October shows the prepaid resources purchased from October 1 to October 31 (if any).

Prepaid resources charged each month

- The resources that charges on a monthly basis: The resource statement of October shows the postpaid resources that charges on a monthly basis used from September 1 to September 30 (if any).

- The resources that charges on a daily basis: The resource statement of October shows the postpaid resources that charges on a daily basis used from September 30 to October 30 (if any).

- The resources that charges on an hourly basis: The resource statement of October shows the postpaid resources that charges on an hourly basis used from 23:00, September 30 to 23:00, October 31 (if any).

The above time may not be exactly when the postpaid resources have a delayed settlement.

- If the postpaid resources that charges on an hourly basis after 22:00, October 31 have a delayed settlement, then the resource statement of October will only show the postpaid resources that charges on an hourly basis used from 23:00, September 30 to 22:00, October 31.
