The CSA Star, a cloud security assurance rating, is based on the Cloud Control Matrix (CCM) developed by the foremost international and non-profit organization, the Cloud Security Alliance.  It satisfies specific cloud computing security sector requirements and is a global certification that targets the characteristics of cloud computing security.  At the same time, it is an enhanced edition of the ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System, and renders the problems unique to cloud security in a visual format, providing cloud service providers with an objective evaluation framework with regard to their security control capabilities.

Tencent Cloud has accumulated extensive experience in security issues over the years, and was conferred the CSA Star certification with a gold rating, in September 2016. At the same time, Tencent Cloud procured both the CNAS and UKAS domestic and overseas certification qualifications in relation to information security management system - the first ever cloud service provider to concurrently attain all these qualifications, further reinforcing its status as the pre-eminent cloud service provider in the country.
