On 1 March 2016, the Telecommunication Business Classification Catalogue (2015 edition) was officially implemented. As compared to the preceding 2003 edition, this revision has a new Content Distribution Network (CDN) Business added to it, which has been classified in category 1 of the value-added telecommunication business, to be so managed. Incorporating CDN into the catalogue signifies that this said business has been subsumed under the ambit of the telecommunications licensing regime.   Hence, an entity operating in this sector would need to apply for a license from the competent authority.

Since the new edition of the Catalogue came into effect, cloud service providers have progressively applied for qualification status with the relevant authorities. Tencent Cloud was granted the said CDN qualification in March 2017.
