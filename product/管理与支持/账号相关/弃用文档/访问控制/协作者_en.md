## 1. What is collaborator?

Collaborator is a collaborating account that can be added and configured by developer in Tencent Cloud.

When the QQ number and information of a collaborator is added in Tencent Cloud collaborator management page, the collaborator can log in to Tencent Cloud via the QQ number and view the information and orders of the developer. 

Based on the assigned permissions, collaborator can perform such operations as top-up, making payment, and managing cloud resources.

## 2. Can an account be both developer and collaborator?

An account registered as a developer cannot be added as a collaborator.

At the same time, if an account has been added as a collaborator, it can no longer be registered as a new developer. If the account needs to be registered as a developer, contact the creator or another collaborator with the permission to manage collaborators, and delete the account from the list of collaborators.
