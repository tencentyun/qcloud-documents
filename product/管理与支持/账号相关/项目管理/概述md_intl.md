Project Management is a feature developed to help developers better manage CVMs. The feature allocates various cloud products into projects, so that resources can be managed by projects. Developers can create and terminate projects, and can also check devices used in each project and their usage by viewing project device and usage details. With Project Management, the developers can improve work efficiency, prevent cloud products used in different projects from interfering with each other, and monitor these cloud products as well.
