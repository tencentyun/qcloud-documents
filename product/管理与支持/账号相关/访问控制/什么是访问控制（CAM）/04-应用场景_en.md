### 1. Sub-account Permission Management in Enterprise

Employees holding different positions within an enterprise need to have minimized access to the cloud resources of the enterprise.

Scenario: An enterprise owns a large amount of cloud resources, including CVM, VPC and CDN instances, as well as COS buckets and objects. At the same time, the enterprise has a large number of employees, including developers, testers, OPS staff, etc. Some developers need to have the read and write permissions for the cloud resources of development machines for their projects, testers need to have the read and write permissions for the cloud resources of the test machines for their project, and OPS staff are responsible for the purchase and daily operation of the machines. When the responsibilities of an employee or the project he or she is involved in changes, the permissions are terminated.

### 2. Authorization Management Between Enterprises

Cloud resources need to be shared between enterprises.

Scenario: An enterprise possessing a large amount of cloud resources wants to focus on product R&D and authorizes another operational company to take care of the operation and maintenance of cloud resources. When the contract entered into with the operational company expires, the management permissions are withdrawn.
