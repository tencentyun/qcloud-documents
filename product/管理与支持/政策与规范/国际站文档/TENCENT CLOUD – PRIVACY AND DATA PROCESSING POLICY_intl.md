It is important for you to understand how we treat Customer Personal Information, so please read this Policy carefully. 

In this Policy:

- 　**"Customer Personal Information"** is Personal Information forming part of Your Content.

- **"Personal Information"** is information that relates directly or indirectly to a living individual from which it is practicable for the identity of the individual to be directly or indirectly ascertained. Personal Information may include your personal details, communication logs, documents, photographs and any other information that you submit to Tencent Cloud that is capable of being used to (directly or indirectly) ascertain a living individual's identity. 
- **"we", "our" or "us"** refers to: (a) Aceville Pte Ltd, a Singaporean company located at 16 Collyer Quay, No. 1829, Level 18, Singapore 049318; and (b) Aceville Pte Ltd's affiliated companies across the world (including any entities that Aceville Pte Ltd acquires in the future).

Please note that where you submit any Personal Information (other than Customer Personal Information) to us in your use of Tencent Cloud, we will use, process and store such Personal Information in accordance with the Tencent Privacy Policy. 

## PARTIES' RESPONSIBILTIES FOR COMPLIANCE

- you represent, warrant and undertake that:

 - in relation to Personal Information that relates to individuals other than yourself (e.g., where you are uploading Personal Information relating to another individual), you have obtained and will obtain all consents required by law and have taken and will take all other steps required of applicable laws and regulations from time to time in order for you to submit, upload, transmit and display the Customer Personal Information for the purpose and in the manner contemplated by the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service; and

## SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY 

This Policy is incorporated into and forms part of the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service that you have agreed to in order to use Tencent Cloud. Any terms used in this Policy will have the same meanings as the equivalent defined terms in the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service, unless otherwise defined in this Policy or the context requires otherwise. 

## CHANGES TO THIS POLICY 

We may from time to time revise or add specific instructions, policies and terms to this Policy and we will post the revised Policy on this page. These instructions, policies and terms form part of this Policy with effect from posting. 

Whenever we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you (within Tencent Cloud, via direct communication to you or other means) prior to such changes becoming effective.

## DATA SECURITY

We take reasonable steps to ensure that Customer Personal Information is protected against unauthorized or accidental access, processing, erasure, loss or use.  To this end, we use a variety of generally accepted security technologies and procedures, as further detailed in the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service, elsewhere within Tencent Cloud and/or as notified to or agreed with you from time to time. 

**Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security at all times. We do not warrant or guarantee the security of Tencent Cloud or any Customer Personal Information.  You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of Tencent Cloud.**

If you have any questions regarding the security of the Customer Personal Information, please contact our Data Protection Officer. 

## SUB-PROCESSORS 

Your Customer Personal Information may be processed (from time to time) within our group of companies and with third party service providers, contractors and agents that provide services to us, such as data management services, analytics and customer service support (collectively, the **"Sub-processors"**). Such processing by Sub-processors will only be for the purpose of supporting our provision of Tencent Cloud to you. 

Where we share Customer Personal Information with Sub-processors, we will ensure that they only process Customer Personal Information in accordance with this Policy. 

## DATA LOCATION SELECTION

You may, within Tencent Cloud, select the server via which you will use Tencent Cloud (the "Data Location Selection"). We will store Your Content at your Data Location Selection, except where we cannot do so (in which case we will notify you of our inability to do so and offer you an alternative storage location). If a Data Location Selection is not covered by the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service or a Data Location Selection is not made by you in respect of any Your Content, we may store and process Your Content in any of our (or our Sub-Processors') locations anywhere in the world, including in jurisdictions that may not have data protection laws which are substantially similar to or serve the same purpose as the laws of your jurisdiction.

**You represent, warrant and undertake that processing by us of your Customer Personal Information in accordance with your Data Location Selection from time to time is and will remain compliant with applicable laws and regulations.**

Please note that regardless of your Data Location Selection (and subject to the terms of the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service), we do not control or limit the locations from which you or your End Users may access Your Content.
