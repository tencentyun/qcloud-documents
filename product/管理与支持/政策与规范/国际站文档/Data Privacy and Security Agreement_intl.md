Such third-party liability of the sub-processor will be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

11.4 The data exporter will keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which will be updated at least once a year. The list will be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.

In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
12.2 The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in Clause 12.1.

#### Technical and Organisational Security Measures

We have implemented a comprehensive privacy and security programme for the purpose of protecting your content. This programme includes the following:
1. **Data security.** We have designed and implemented the following measures to protect customer's data against unauthorised access:  <ol style = 'list-style-type :lower-latin'><li>standards for data categorisation and classification; </li><li>a set of authentication and access control capabilities at the physical, network, system and application levels; and </li><li>a mechanism for detecting big data-based abnormal behaviour.</li></ol>
2. **Network security.** We implement stringent rules on internal network isolation to achieve access control and border protection for internal networks (including office networks, development networks, testing networks and production networks) by way of physical and logical isolation.
3.  **Physical and environmental security.** Stringent infrastructure and environment access controls have been implemented for Tencent Cloud's data centres based on relevant regional security requirements.  An access control matrix is established, based on the types of data centre personnel and their respective access privileges, to ensure effective management and control of access and operations by data centre personnel.
4. **Incident management.** We operate active and real-time service monitoring, combined with a rapid response and handling mechanism, that enables prompt detection and handling of security incidents.
5. **Compliance with standards.** We comply with the following standards: <ol style = 'list-style-type :lower-latin'><li>Information security management system – ISO 27001:2013.</li><li>IT service management – ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011.</li><li>Quality management system – ISO/IEC 9001:2015. </li><li>IT Service Management System – ISO/IEC 27018:2014</li><li>CSA Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (STAR)</li></ol>
