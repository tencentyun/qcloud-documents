**SCOPE AND APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY**

This Policy is incorporated into and forms part of the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service that you have agreed to in order to use Tencent Cloud. Any terms used in this Policy will have the same meanings as the equivalent defined terms in the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service, unless otherwise defined in this Policy or the context requires otherwise. 


**CHANGES TO THIS POLICY**

We may from time to time revise or add specific instructions, policies and terms to this Policy and we will post the revised Policy on this page. These instructions, policies and terms form part of this Policy with effect from posting. 

Whenever we make any material changes to this Policy, we will notify you (within Tencent Cloud, via direct communication to you or other means) prior to such changes becoming effective.

**DATA SECURITY**

We take reasonable steps to ensure that Customer Personal Information is protected against unauthorized or accidental access, processing, erasure, loss or use.  To this end, we use a variety of generally accepted security technologies and procedures, as further detailed in the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service, elsewhere within Tencent Cloud and/or as notified to or agreed with you from time to time. 

**Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security at all times. We do not warrant or guarantee the security of Tencent Cloud or any Customer Personal Information.  You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of Tencent Cloud.**

If you have any questions regarding the security of the Customer Personal Information, please contact our Data Protection Officer. 

**SUB-PROCESSORS**

Your Customer Personal Information may be processed (from time to time) within our group of companies and with third party service providers, contractors and agents that provide services to us, such as data management services, analytics and customer service support (collectively, the "Sub-processors"). Such processing by Sub-processors will only be for the purpose of supporting our provision of Tencent Cloud to you. 

Where we share Customer Personal Information with Sub-processors, we will ensure that they only process Customer Personal Information in accordance with this Policy. 

**DATA LOCATION SELECTION**

You may, within Tencent Cloud, select the server via which you will use Tencent Cloud (the "Data Location Selection"). We will store Your Content at your Data Location Selection, except where we cannot do so (in which case we will notify you of our inability to do so and offer you an alternative storage location). If a Data Location Selection is not covered by the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service or a Data Location Selection is not made by you in respect of any Your Content, we may store and process Your Content in any of our (or our Sub-Processors') locations anywhere in the world, including in jurisdictions that may not have data protection laws which are substantially similar to or serve the same purpose as the laws of your jurisdiction.

**You represent, warrant and undertake that processing by us of your Customer Personal Information in accordance with your Data Location Selection from time to time is and will remain compliant with applicable laws and regulations.**

Please note that regardless of your Data Location Selection (and subject to the terms of the Tencent Cloud Terms of Service), we do not control or limit the locations from which you or your End Users may access Your Content. 

**RETENTION OR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR CONTENT FOR LEGAL PURPOSES**

   - may retain or disclose Your Content where we reasonably believe we should or must do so in order to protect our or your legal rights;
