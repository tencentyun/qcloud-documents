### How is Tencent Cloud billed?
Three billing methods are supported:
1. [Postpaid](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/9617), which means that the resources are billed by the actual usage amount and time. This billing method does not require any prepayment, and the resources are released whenever you purchase the service. Besides, you can adjust the configuration flexibly according to the business needs.
2. [Prepaid](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/9618). By paying in advance, you can reserve sufficient resources to reduce potential risks, manage budgets predictably, and enjoy favorable discounts.
3. [Tiered Pricing](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/11788). This billing mode saves significant costs for users who deploy large amounts of businesses on Tencent Cloud. More usage amount means lower unit price, and longer usage time means bigger discount.     

### Is there any difference between products in different regions?
Yes. Mature products are released on all servers while new products are given a trial release in some selected regions.

### How to select a region when purchasing a product?  
We have set up multiple IDCs across China to solve the problem of limited bandwidth. To obtain quality service and minimize delay, select the region closest to you when purchasing a product. For example, if you are located in Guangzhou, select South China.

### What to do if data remains in a disabled product? 
Before a product is disabled, you should migrate the relevant data from this product to other products to avoid unnecessary loss.

### What does it mean that a voucher can be used for many times?
