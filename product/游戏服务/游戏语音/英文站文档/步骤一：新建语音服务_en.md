### 1.1 Add Game  
On the game management page, you can create your games. A game ID and a game KEY are generated automatically when a game is created, which are used when you call the voice API.

### 1.2 Free Experience Zone  
A "Free Experience Zone" is created on the game management page by default. You can experience the voice service for free and use it for testing purpose. 
The capacity for free experience zone is limited. Both ID and KEY must be replaced with the ones for paid game when the service is running formally.

## 2. Activate Voice Service

When a game is created successfully, the voice service is not activated by default, and needs to be activated manually. You also need to manually activate the service for "Free Experience Zone". If the voice service has been activated for "Free Experience Zone", the voice icon is illuminated, otherwise it is gray.
