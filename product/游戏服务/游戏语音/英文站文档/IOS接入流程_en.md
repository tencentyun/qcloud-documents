## 1.Instructions
This document describes how to connect Objective-C API SDK for GVoice, which is applicable to games or APPs directly developed on iOS platform.

GVoice provides two major functions, namely, the voice chat (Real-Time) and voice message (Message). The voice chat function enables multiple players to have a voice chat in real time, while the voice message function enables users to make recording rapidly and send a voice message to other players.

Voice chat is divided into two modes, namely the team voice chat and the national war voice chat. If the number of players chatting at the same time in a room is less than 20, it is recommended to use the team voice chat (usually used for communication among team members) for free chatting. If the number above is more than 20, it is recommended to use the national war voice chat (usually used for team battle commands and hosting), which allows developers to control the speaking permission and no more than 5 players to speak at the same time.

Client SDK APIs of GVoice are mainly divided into three parts: the basic API, voice chat API and voice message API.

### 1.1 System Configuration and Basic Usage
[Download IOS SDK](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/556/10041)  
[Download IOS Demo](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/556/10042)


(1) After downloading and extracting the iOS SDK package, you can obtain a .a file, a .h file and a bundle file. And you can access the APIs by following the procedure below. 1„ÄÅ Import the following library files and bundle files into Xcode project:
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/b980d0e2ba93fd8ce0884170c6cab596/1.png)

Import the following library files:
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/00705b94a989e2d452846136c971095f/2.png)


The microphone permission needs to be configured in Info for iOS10 and above.

![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/4f821f50b9c45118cba2cd17c34f5a94/3.png)


(2) Put the header file "GVoice.h" in a proper place, and initialize the engine.

GVoice uses the singleton method [GVGVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] to obtain sample objects and perform relevant operations. First of all, set the applied information, and then initialize the engine:

    [[GVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] setAppInfo:"your_appid" withKey:"your_appkey" andOpenID:"your_open_id"];
	[[GVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] initEngine];

(3) Before using voice, you need to set the voice mode and carry out callback of delegate.

    [[GVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] setMode:RealTime];

    @interface TeamRoomViewController : UIViewController <GVGCloudVoiceDelegate>
    @end

    #pragma mark delegate

        - (void) onJoinRoom:(enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) code withRoomName: (const char * _Nullable)roomName andMemberID:(int) memberID {
        }

        - (void) onStatusUpdate:(enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) status withRoomName: (const char * _Nullable)roomName andMemberID:(int) memberID {

        }

        - (void) onQuitRoom:(enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) code withRoomName: (const char * _Nullable)roomName {
        }

        - (void) onMemberVoice:    (const unsigned int * _Nullable)members withCount: (int) count {
        }

        - (void) onUploadFile: (enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) code withFilePath: (const char * _Nullable)filePath andFileID:(const char * _Nullable)fileID  {

        }

        - (void) onDownloadFile: (enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) code  withFilePath: (const char * _Nullable)filePath andFileID:(const char * _Nullable)fileID {

        }

        - (void) onPlayRecordedFile:(enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) code withFilePath: (const char * _Nullable)filePath {

        }

        - (void) onApplyMessageKey:(enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) code {

        }

        - (void) onSpeechToText:(enum GCloudVoiceCompleteCode) code withFileID:(const char * _Nullable)fileID andResult:( const char * _Nullable)result {

        }

        - (void) onRecording:(const unsigned char* _Nullable) pAudioData withLength: (unsigned int) nDataLength {

        }
  
(4) To drive the callback, you need to call Poll function regularly so as to trigger the callback.

For example, you can call Poll function through a timer in the UI thread:

    _pollTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1.000/15 repeats:YES block:^(NSTimer * _Nonnull timer) {
    [[GVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] poll];
    }];
  
(5) Join a room: (you can know whether you have joined a room successful or not in the callback of joining a room).

   `[[GVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] joinTeamRoom:[_roomID cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] timeout:18000];`
  
(6) If the callback indicates that you have joined a room successfully, you can enalbe the microphone and speaker to start a voice chat.

      [[GVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] openSpeaker];

### 1.2 API Calling Process
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/db4301975a4007a65e2b71152e103fd4/4.png)



- Implement callback library GVGCloudVoiceDelegate.  


- Obtain GVGCloudVoice object by calling [GVGCloudVoice sharedInstance] method of GVGCloudVoice.  


- Initialize the object and set the callback.  


- Call the voice chat API or voice message API as required.  


- Call the poll() function where the system tick happens (such as Update of Unity3D ) to run the program.  
### 1.3 Voice Chat API Calling Procedure
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/d7eb0df95ebdff5e8f9d44a8a01bd74f/5.png)



- Set the voice chat mode by calling setMode().


- Use the team voice chat or the national war voice chat based on business needs by calling joinTeamRoom() or joinNationalRoom() respectively.


- If Tick is required, call poll to check the callback. If you succeed or fail to join a room, onJoinRoomComplete() will be called back.


- After joining a room successfully, you can enable the microphone by calling openMic() to capture data and send it to the network.


- Enable the speaker by calling openSpeaker() to receive the audio stream on the network and play it automatically.


- Exit a room by calling QuitRoom() as required. And then onQuitRoomComplete() will be called back.  

Notes:  
In the national war voice chat mode, no more than 5 players can speak at the same time. And additional role information is attached to each user. When joining a room, each user needs to specify himself/herself as a listener or a host.

### 1.4 Offline Voice Chat API Calling Procedure
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/28ec9bf0eab80c06c7883219fbd7604a/6.png)



- Set the voice message mode by calling setMode method.


- Obtain the voice message security key information by calling applyMessageKey(). After the application succeeds, the callback will be carried out via onApplyMessageKeyComplete.


- When recording is required, call startRecording() to record the voice as a file (the file path format is /your path).


- If you want to cancel the recording, call stopRecording API to cancel it.


- After the recording is completed, call uploadRecordedFile to upload the file to GcloudVoice server, during which a ShareFileID will be returned through onUploadReccordFileComplete callback when the file is uploaded successfully. As the unique identifier of this file, this ID is used for file downloading when other users want to listen to it. And the server manages and forwards the ID.


- When the game client needs to listen to other people's audio recording, first of all, it needs to obtain the ShareFileID forwarded by the server, and then download the concerning language file by calling DownloadRecordedFile. The download result will be notified via OnDownloadFile callback. When the downloading is successful, you can call PlayRecordedFile to play the downloaded audio data. Similarly, if you want to cancel the playing, you can call StopPlayFile to cancel it.
### 1.5 Voice-to-text Calling Procedure
![](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/c0789172ff0ffb679cc9beeb3ba4d18b/7.png)



- Set the translation mode by calling setMode method.


- Obtain the voice message security key information by calling applyMessageKey(). After the application succeeds, the callback will be carried out via onApplyMessageKeyComplete.


- If you want to make recording, call startRecording() to record a voice as a file (the format of file path is /your path).


- If you want to cancel the recording, call stopRecording API to cancel it.


- After the recording is completed, call uploadRecordedFile to upload the file to GcloudVoice server, during which a ShareFileID will be returned through onUploadReccordFileComplete callback when the file is uploaded successfully. As the unique identifier of this file, this ID is used for file downloading when other users want to listen to it. And the server manages and forwards the ID.
To use the translation feature, you need to call speechToText with one important parameter, namely fileid in the last step. After this function is called, the translation result will be notified in the onSpeechToText callback.

Note: The translated fileidIt is generated in the tranlation mode rather than the message mode.
