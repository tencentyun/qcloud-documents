> - Monthly minimum charge is 5,000 CNY. The monthly minimum charge is the minimum amount that customers promise to pay each month. Total monthly amount less than 5,000 CNY is counted as 5,000 CNY. For that exceeding 5,000 CNY, you will be charged for the actual amount incurred.
> - During the promotion period, the monthly minimum charge is not mandatory. However, you will be charged according to the actual monthly usage fee and calling fee.
> - Real-time chat relies on LVB service, so besides the LVB traffic that is converted to call duration, other billing items and billing rules are consistent with the billing policies of LVB product.
