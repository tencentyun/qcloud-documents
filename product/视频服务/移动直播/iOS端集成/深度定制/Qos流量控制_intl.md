## Background
RTMP push quality is crucial to the viewing experience. A poor push quality at VJ end will cause the stutter at all the viewer ends. According to the statistics, over 80% of LVB stutters among Video Cloud customers are caused by a poor RTMP push quality.

Among the push quality issues, the biggest issue is caused by unsatisfactory uplink network at VJ end. Insufficient uplink bandwidth can make audio/video data build up and then be dropped at VJ end, thus leading to the stutter or even long freezing of video images at viewer end.

Therefore, dealing with the stutter of uplink network at VJ end can effectively improve the push quality, thus delivering a better viewing experience, especially in the domestic environment where uplink bandwidth is restricted widely by ISPs.

But network condition does not hinge on our will. If a VJ uses a 4-Mbps broadband package at home, it is not impossible to change it to 8Mbps just because the VJ installs a new App. Therefore, we can choose to**actively adapt to the uplink network**.

## Quick integrating
You can enable the Qos traffic control with the parameters of the setVideoQuality API of TXLivePusher. The SDK will then decide the video definition according to VJ's uplink network condition.

- **quality**
The SDK provides six basic options which are developed and configured based on our rich experience with our huge customer base. Among them, STANDARD, HIGH, and SUPER are intended for LVB mode, MAIN_PUBLISHER and SUB_PUBLISHER are intended for primary and secondary screens of joint broadcasting, and VIDEOCHAT is used for real-time audio/video.

- **adjustBitrate**
Specifies whether to enable Qos traffic control. If enabled, the SDK decides the video definition according to VJ's uplink network condition. The disadvantage is that blurry screens and many mosaics may occur in case of poor network condition on the VJ end.

- **adjustResolution**
Specifies whether to support dynamic resolution. If enabled, the SDK selects a appropriate resolution based on the current video bitrate for better definition. The disadvantage is that files generated by recording live streaming with dynamic resolutions may have compatibility issue with many players.

## Fine Adjustment
If the default parameters in setVideoQuality are not enough, you can customize more parameters via TXLivePushConfig:

- **enableAutoBitrate**
Specifies whether to enable the adaptive bitrate, i.e. Qos traffic control. If enabled, the SDK decides the video definition according to VJ's uplink network condition.

- **autoAdjustStrategy**
Available only when the adaptive bitrate is enabled, otherwise the setting is invalid. The autoAdjustStrategy supports the following four strategies:

| Strategy Name | Description |
|---------|---------|
| AUTO_ADJUST_BITRATE_STRATEGY_1 | Constantly detects and adjusts the network speed throughout the LVB process. It is intended for scenarios such as live shows. | 
| AUTO_ADJUST_BITRATE_RESOLUTION_STRATEGY_1 | Adjusts the bitrate while adjusting the resolution accordingly to keep a balance between bitrate and resolution. | 
| AUTO_ADJUST_BITRATE_STRATEGY_2 | Quickly detects and adjusts the network speed in the first half minutes of LVB accordingly, and then minimize the adjustment. It is intended for mobile game scenarios. | 
| AUTO_ADJUST_BITRATE_RESOLUTION_STRATEGY_2 | Adjusts the bitrate while adjusting the resolution accordingly to keep a balance between bitrate and resolution. | 

- **videoBitrateMin**: Represents the minimum bitrate, which is available only when the adaptive bitrate is enabled, otherwise the setting is invalid.
- **videoBitrateMax**: Represents the maximum bitrate, which is available only when the adaptive bitrate is enabled, otherwise the setting is invalid.
- **videoBitratePIN**: Represents the original bitrate, videoBitrateMin <= videoBitratePIN <= videoBitrateMax.
