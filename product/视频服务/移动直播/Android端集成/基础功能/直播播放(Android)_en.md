## Basics
RTMP SDK includes two features, Push and Playback. Push works at the VJ side, while Playback, including Live Video Broadcasting (LVB) and Video On Demand (VOD), functions at the viewer side. Before getting started with the code interfacing, let's learn some basic facts:

- **LVB and VOD**
LVB's video source is generated in real time, and  only makes sense when someone pushes the LVB stream. Therefore, once the VJ stops broadcasting, the LVB URL will become invalid. Since the video is played in real time, no progress bar is displayed on the player during the LVB.

VOD's video source is a file on cloud, which can be played at any time as long as it has not been deleted by the provider. Since the entire video file is stored on the server, a progress bar will be displayed during the playback.

- **Supported Protocols**
Commonly used LVB protocols are as follows. It is recommended to use LVB URL based on FLV protocol (starting with "http" and ending with ".flv") on APPs:

 Commonly used VOD protocols are as follows. Currently, HLS VOD addresses are most commonly used (starting with "http" and ending with ".m3u8"):

## Notes
The SDK **DOES NOT ** impose any restrictions on the source of playback URLs, which means you can use the SDK to play videos from both Tencent Cloud and non-Tencent Cloud addresses. But the player in the SDK only supports three LVB video address formats (FLV, RTMP and HLS (m3u8)) and three VOD address formats (MP4, HLS (m3u8) and FLV).

## Interfacing Guide

### Step 1:  Add a view
To display the video views in a player, we first need to add the following codes into the layout xml file:
```xml
<com.tencent.rtmp.ui.TXCloudVideoView
            android:id="@+id/video_view"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:layout_centerInParent="true"
            android:visibility="gone"/>
```

### Step 2:  Create a Player
Next, create a **TXLivePlayer** object, and then use API setPlayerView to associate it with the **video_view** control we just added to the interface.
```java
//mPlayerView is the interface View added in step 1
TXCloudVideoView mPlayerView = (TXCloudVideoView) view.findViewById(R.id.video_view);
//Create a Player object
TXLivePlayer mLivePlayer = new TXLivePlayer(getActivity());
//Key Player object and interface View
mLivePlayer.setPlayerView(mPlayerView);
```

### Step 3:  Launch the Player
```java
String flvUrl = "http://2157.liveplay.myqcloud.com/live/2157_xxxx.flv";
mLivePlayer.startPlay(flvUrl, TXLivePlayer.PLAY_TYPE_LIVE_FLV); //FLV is recommended
```
Parameter type supports the following options. According to the feedback from some customers, **"fast forward" sometimes occurs during playback**. This is because they confused LIVE_FLV and VOD_FLV.

| Option | Enumerated Value | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| PLAY_TYPE_LIVE_RTMP | 0 | The input URL is an RTMP-based LVB URL |
| PLAY_TYPE_LIVE_FLV| 1 | The input URL is an FLV-based LVB URL |
| PLAY_TYPE_VOD_FLV | 2 | The input URL is an RTMP-based VOD URL |
| PLAY_TYPE_VOD_HLS | 3 | The input URL is an HLS (m3u8)-based VOD URL |
| PLAY_TYPE_VOD_MP4 |4 | The input URL is an MP4-based VOD URL |
| PLAY_TYPE_LIVE_RTMP_ACC | 5 | Low-latency joint broadcasting LVB URL (for joint broadcasting scenarios only) |
| PLAY_TYPE_LOCAL_VIDEO | 6 | Local video file on mobile phone |

### Step 4:  Adjust View

- **View: Size and Position**
You can modify the size and position of the view by directly adjusting the size and position of the "video_view" control added in step 1.

- **setRenderMode: Full Screen or Self-Adaption**

| Option | Description  |
|---------|---------|
| RENDER_MODE_FILL_SCREEN | The entire screen is filled with the view which is spread proportionally, with the excess parts cut out. There will be no black edges in this mode, but certain sections may not be displayed completely because some areas are cut out.  | 
| RENDER_MODE_FILL_EDGE | The view is scaled proportionally to adapt to the longest edge. The width and height of the scaled view will not extend beyond the display area and the view is centered. In this mode, black edges may appear on the screen.  | 

- **setRenderRotation: Screen Rotation**

| Option | Description |
|---------|---------|
| RENDER_ROTATION_PORTRAIT | Normal playback (The Home button is located directly below the video) | 
| RENDER_ROTATION_LANDSCAPE | The video rotates 270Â° clockwise (the Home button is directly to the left of the video) |

### Step 5:  Adjust Progress
Adjusting playback progress ** is only applicable to VOD**. You cannot adjust the video progress during LVB because the video source is in real-time.
```java
// Adjust progress
mLivePlayer.seek(seekBar.getProgress());
```

### Step 6:  Pause Playback
- **VOD**
Pausing the video during VOD is of course, a common practice.

- **LVB**
For LVB, calling pause function means temporarily stopping stream-pull. The player will not be terminated, but will display the last frame.

```java
// Pause
mLivePlayer.pause();
// Resume
mLivePlayer.resume();
```

### Step 7:  End Playback
At the end of the playback, **be sure to terminate the View control**, especially before the next startPlay. Otherwise a lot of memory leaks and splash screen issues will occur.

At the same time, when exiting the playback interface, be sure to call the `onDestroy()` function of the rendering View, otherwise memory leak and the warning message **Receiver not registered** may occur.
```java
@Override
public void onDestroy() {
	super.onDestroy();
	mLivePlayer.stopPlay(true); // true means to clear the last frame
	mPlayerView.onDestroy(); 
}
```

The boolean parameter of stopPlay means whether to clear the last frame. The LVB players in the earlier versions of RTMP SDK did not have the concept of Pause, so the boolean value is used to control whether to clear the last frame.

### Step 8:  Hardware Acceleration
For blu-ray (1080p) quality, it is difficult to obtain smooth playback experience just by using software decoding. Therefore, if your scenario focuses on gaming LVB, it is recommended to enable hardware acceleration.

It is strongly recommended to perform **stopPlay** before the switching between software decoding and hardware decoding, and then perform **startPlay** after switching. Otherwise seriously blurred screen may occur.

```java
 mLivePlayer.stopPlay(true);
 mLivePlayer.enableHardwareDecode(true);
 mLivePlayer.startPlay(flvUrl, type);
```

### Step 9:  Stream capture recording (for LVB only)
Stream capture recording is an extended feature in LVB playback scenarios. It means that during the LVB, the viewer can capture and record a segment of the video by clicking the "Record" button and publish the recorded content via video delivery platforms (e.g. Tencent Cloud VOD system) so that the content can be shared on social platforms (such as WeChat Moments) in the form of UGC messages.

![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/2963b8f0af228976c9c7f2b11a514744/image.png)

```java
//Specify an ITXVideoRecordListener to synchronize the progress and results of the recording process
mLivePlayer.setVideoRecordListener(recordListener);
//Start recording. It can be placed in the response function of the "Record" button. Currently you can only record the video source, but not the other contents such as the live comments
mLivePlayer.startRecord(int recordType);
// ...
// ...
//End the recording. It can be placed in the response function of the "End" button
mLivePlayer.stopRecord();
```

- The progress of recording process is indicated as a time value by the onRecordProgress of ITXVideoRecordListener.
- The recorded file is in the format of MP4, and is informed by onRecordComplete of ITXVideoRecordListener.
- TXUGCPublish is used to upload and publish videos. For details on how to use TXUGCPublish, refer to [Short Video-Publish Files](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/584/9367#6.-.E6.96.87.E4.BB.B6.E5.8F.91.E5.B8.8310).


### Step 10: Video Screenshot
Viewers can use the screenshot feature to capture any interesting images during the VJ's LVB and save them. Screenshot only captures one frame of the original image for the current video stream, instead of the entire screen.
```
mLivePlayer.snapshot(new ITXSnapshotListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSnapshot(Bitmap bmp) {
        if (null != bmp) {
           //Acquire screenshot bitmap
        }
    }
});
```

## Status Monitor
Tencent Cloud RTMP SDK is always designed on a basis of White Box. You can bind a **TXLivePlayListener** for the TXLivePlayer object so that you can receive notifications regarding the internal status of SDK through onPlayEvent (Event Notification) and onNetStatus (Quality Feedback).

### 1. Playback Events
| Event ID                 |    Value  |  Description                    |   
| :-------------------  |:-------- |  :------------------------ | 
| PLAY_EVT_PLAY_BEGIN    |  2004 |  Video playback begins. The "loading" icon stops flashing at this point | 
| PLAY_EVT_PLAY_PROGRESS |  2005 |  Video playback progress, including current progress and overall progress. ** This is only applicable to VOD**      | 
| PLAY_EVT_PLAY_LOADING |  2007 | Video playback is being loaded. If video playback is resumed, this will be followed by a BEGIN event |  

- **Do not hide the playback view after receiving PLAY_LOADING**
The time length between PLAY_LOADING and PLAY_BEGIN can be different (sometimes 5 seconds, sometimes 5 milliseconds). Some customers consider hiding the view upon LOADING and displaying the view upon BEGIN, which will cause serious flickering (especially in LVB scenarios). It is recommended to place a translucent Loading animation on top of the video view.

- **The frequency of LOADING is determined by cacheTime**
You can configure the player's cacheTime attribute in TXLivePlayConfig. A small cacheTime value can cause a high LOADING frequency. If this happens, please make adjustments while referring to [Stutter & Latency](#.E5.8D.A1.E9.A1.BF.26amp.3B.E5.BB.B6.E8.BF.9F).

- **Work with PLAY_PROGRESS playback progress**
If you have no idea aboutâhow to handle the PLAY_EVT_PLAY_PROGRESS event during VOD, refer to the sample code - [Playback Progress](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/454/7887).

### 2. Ending Events
| Event ID                 |    Value  |  Description                    |   
| :-------------------  |:-------- |  :------------------------ | 
| PLAY_EVT_PLAY_END      |  2006 |  Video playback ends      | 
| PUSH_ERR_NET_DISCONNECT          |  -2301  | Network disconnected. Reconnection attempts have failed for multiple times, thus no more retries will be performed. Please restart playback manually | 

- **How to tell whether the LVB has ended?**
For **VOD**, we can check whether the playback has ended through the PLAY_EVT_PLAY_END event.

 For **LVB**, we can't determine if the VJ has ended the push only by using the SDK. It is expected that when the VJ stops pushing stream, the SDK will soon find the data stream pull failed (WARNING_RECONNECT), and attempt to retry until the PLAY_ERR_NET_DISCONNECT event is thrown after three failed attempts.

 The reason for this is that the standard playback protocol itself does not have a generic STOP standard, so it is recommended to achieve your purpose by broadcasting a system message such as **"LVB has ended"** in the chat room.
 
### 3. Warning Events
You don't need to consider the following events. We listed the information of these events for synchronization purposes, according to the SDK white-box design concept

| Event ID                 |    Value  |  Description                    |   
| :-------------------  |:-------- |  :------------------------ | 
| PLAY_WARNING_VIDEO_DECODE_FAIL |  2101  | Failed to decode the current video frame |
| PLAY_WARNING_AUDIO_DECODE_FAIL | 2102 | Failed to decode the current audio frame |
| PLAY_WARNING_RECONNECT | 2103 | Network disconnected, automatic reconnection has started (the PLAY_ERR_NET_DISCONNECT event will be thrown after three failed attempts) |
| PLAY_WARNING_RECV_DATA_LAG | 2104 | Unstable incoming packet from network: This may be caused by insufficient downstream bandwidth, or unstable outgoing stream at the VJ end |
| PLAY_WARNING_VIDEO_PLAY_LAG | 2105 | Stutter occurred during the current video playback |
| PUSH_WARNING_HW_ACCELERATION_FAIL | 2106 | Failed to start hard-decoding; Soft-decoding is used |
| PLAY_WARNING_VIDEO_DISCONTINUITY | 2107 | Current video frames are discontinuous and frame loss may occur |
| PLAY_WARNING_DNS_FAIL | 3001 | RTMP-DNS resolution failed (thrown only if the playback address is RTMP) |
| PLAY_WARNING_SEVER_CONN_FAIL | 3002 | Failed to connect to RTMP server (thrown only if the playback address is RTMP) |
| PLAY_WARNING_SHAKE_FAIL | 3003 | RTMP server handshake failed (thrown only if the playback address is RTMP) |

### 4. Connection Events
In addition, there are several server connection events used to measure and calculate the time for server connections. Also, you don't have to be concerned:

| Event ID                     |    Value  |  Description                    |   
| :-----------------------  |:-------- |  :------------------------ | 
| PLAY_EVT_CONNECT_SUCC | 2001 | Connected to the server |
| PLAY_EVT_RTMP_STREAM_BEGIN | 2002 | Connected to the server and started to pull stream (thrown only if the playback address is RTMP) |
| PLAY_EVT_RCV_FIRST_I_FRAME | 2003 | The network has received the first renderable video packet (IDR) |


### 5. Status Callback 
 The **onNetStatus** notification is triggered once per second to provide real-time feedback on the current status of the pusher. Like a car dashboard, it can offer you a picture about what is happening inside the current SDK, so that you can keep track of current network conditions and video quality.
  
|   Evaluation Parameter                   |  Description                   |   
| :------------------------  |  :------------------------ | 
| NET_STATUS_CPU_USAGE | Current CPU utilization (instantaneous) | 
| NET_STATUS_VIDEO_WIDTH | Video resolution - Width |
| NET_STATUS_VIDEO_HEIGHT | Video resolution - Height |
| NET_STATUS_NET_SPEED | Current network data receiving speed |
| NET_STATUS_NET_JITTER | Network jitter status. A bigger jitter means a more unstable network |
| NET_STATUS_VIDEO_FPS | The video frame rate of the current stream media |
| NET_STATUS_VIDEO_BITRATE | Video bitrate of the current stream media (in kbps) |
| NET_STATUS_AUDIO_BITRATE | Audio bitrate of the current stream media (in kbps) |
| NET_STATUS_CACHE_SIZE | Buffer size (jitterbuffer). A buffer length of 0 means that stutter will occur in all probability |
| NET_STATUS_SERVER_IP | IP of the connected server | 

## Stutter & Latency
In LVB scenarios, the occurrence frequency of stutters and latency level are critical indicators used to measure the user experience of an App product.

**The player itself plays an important role in these measurements**. With the same network environment and playback address, different players may yield completely different latency and stutter occurrence. (For example, commonly used flash players on PC browsers may have increasing latency because the playback policies are too simple)

Therefore, once you have finished the functional code interfacing listed in previous sections of this document, make sure you read the [Stutter Optimization-Player Optimization](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/454/7946#5.-.E6.92.AD.E6.94.BE.E7.AB.AF.E7.9A.84.E4.BC.98.E5.8C.969) and make adjustments until you've achieved the best playback mode for your business scenario.

- **Performance comparison among the three modes**

![](//mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/1d5a860ff74f9d026a36c04dd8bb27ef/image.jpg)

- **Interface codes of the three modes**

```java
TXLivePlayConfig mPlayConfig = new TXLivePlayConfig();

//Auto mode
mPlayConfig.setAutoAdjustCacheTime(true);
mPlayConfig.setMinAutoAdjustCacheTime(1);
mPlayConfig.setMaxAutoAdjustCacheTime(5);

//Speedy mode
mPlayConfig.setAutoAdjustCacheTime(true);
mPlayConfig.setMinAutoAdjustCacheTime(1);
mPlayConfig.setMaxAutoAdjustCacheTime(1);

//Smooth mode
mPlayConfig.setAutoAdjustCacheTime(false);
mPlayConfig.setCacheTime(5);

mLivePlayer.setConfig(mPlayConfig);
//Launch the playback once configuration is completed

```


Note: Cloud providers usually introduce a latency of **1.5-2 seconds** on their CDN. This is unavoidable, thus the **total latency = CDN latency + CacheTime.**
