## Plugin Introduction

Tencent Cloud QUIC Push Acceleration Plug-in provides your OBS Studio with QUIC push acceleration capability, allowing you to achieve better network adaptability and lower LVB stutter rate than conventional RTMP push.

After the plug-in is installed, if streams are to be pushed to the Tencent Cloud server, the QUIC push acceleration capability is enabled by default. If streams are to be pushed to other cloud servers, the standard RTMP protocol is used for pushing.
