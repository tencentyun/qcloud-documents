## Reclamation of Resources upon Suspension of VOD Service
To ensure that you can use our service normally, we will suspend the service of customers whose accounts are in arrears, and reclaim the resources allocated to the customers with long-standing arrears.

## Rules for Service Suspension

1. Policy of service suspension: Fees generated in current day are billed and deducted between 12:00 and 18:00 on next day, during which bills are also generated. If deduction failed due to insufficient balance, the overdraft notice is sent on the same day. If the account has not been topped up from 8:00 to 12:00 on next day, the service is officially suspended, otherwise it is not suspended.
2. Suspended service: You are not allowed to use the console and all the services provided by VOD upon the suspension of service. However, VOD files and configuration information are not deleted or modified.
3. Policy of service activation: The service is automatically activated after the account is topped up to an amount greater than 0.
4. Reclamation policy: After the service is suspended, if the account is not topped up to an amount greater than 0 within 30 days, the reclamation policy is enabled. We will then delete the source files and transcoded files stored on Tencent Cloud VOD to release resources. This operation cannot be undone. To protect your file from accidental deletion, pay attention to your account's arrearage information and make payments in time.
