**What is the number of requests?**

The number of requests refers to the total number of playback requests submitted to CDN in a period of time. It includes the statistics of all the origins, including Tencent Cloud player, web page and customized player. The number of requests is related to the video format. If the format is MP4, the number of requests equals to the number of playbacks; if the format is HLS, the number of requests equals to the number of requests for m3u8 and TS slices. This value is updated every 5 minutes.

>Note: The number of playbacks is reported by the Tencent Cloud player with only the source information about the use of Tencent Cloud player; this value is updated every 3 hours. The information about the statistics of traffic is reported by CDN node with the statistics of all the origins (including Tencent Cloud player, web page and customized player); this value is updated every 1 hour.
