Tencent Cloud VOD provides Android upload DEMO for the scenario of uploading videos on the Android platform. For more information about upload process, please see [Upload Videos from Client](/document/product/266/9219).

## Download Source Code

You can update [Android upload demo+source code](http://ugcupload-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/LiteAVSDK_UGC_Upload_Android.zip) on the Tencent Cloud official website.
You can see the Demo directory after decompressing the downloaded zip file. Upload-related source code is located in Demo/app/src/main/java/com/tencent/ugcupload/demo/videoupload.

## Integrate Upload Library and Source Code

1. Copy the upload source code directory Demo/app/src/main/java/com/tencent/ugcupload/demo/videoupload to your project directory, but the package name needs to be modified manually.
2. Integrate all the jar packages under directory Demo/app/libs/upload into your project. Keep the upload directory structure so that you can update the library later.

Dependent libraries:

| jar file | Description |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| cos-xml-android-sdk-1.2.jar | File upload package of Tencent Cloud COS. This component is used for uploading videos (TXUGCPublish) |
| qcloud-core-1.2.jar | File upload package of Tencent Cloud COS. This component is used for uploading videos (TXUGCPublish) |
| okhttp-3.8.1.jar | Open source HTTP component |
| okio-1.13.0.jar | Open source network I/O component |
| xstream-1.4.7.jar | Open source serialization component |
| fastjson-1.1.62.android.jar | Open source json component |

3. Some access permissions related to network and storage are required for uploading videos. The following permission declarations can be added in AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

## Simple Upload of Video
### Initialize an upload object

```java
TXUGCPublish mVideoPublish = new TXUGCPublish(this.getApplicationContext(), "carol_android")
```

### Set callback for the upload object

```java
mVideoPublish.setListener(new TXUGCPublishTypeDef.ITXVideoPublishListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPublishProgress(long uploadBytes, long totalBytes) {
        mProgress.setProgress((int) (100*uploadBytes/totalBytes));
    }

    @Override
    public void onPublishComplete(TXUGCPublishTypeDef.TXPublishResult result) {
        mResultMsg.setText(result.retCode + " Msg:" + (result.retCode == 0 ? result.videoURL : result.descMsg));
    }
});
```

### Construct the upload parameters

```java
TXUGCPublishTypeDef.TXPublishParam param = new TXUGCPublishTypeDef.TXPublishParam();

param.signature = "xxx";
param.videoPath = "xxx";
```
>For the rules on computing signature, see [Upload Signature of Client](/document/product/266/9221).

### Call upload

```java
int publishCode = mVideoPublish.publishVideo(param);
```

## Advanced Features
### Upload cover

Include the cover path in the upload parameter.

```java
TXUGCPublishTypeDef.TXPublishParam param = new TXUGCPublishTypeDef.TXPublishParam();

param.signature = "xxx";
param.videoPath = "xxx";
param.coverPath = "xxx";
```
>For the rules on computing signature, see [Upload Signature of Client](/document/product/266/9221).

### Cancel and resume upload

To cancel an upload, call `canclePublish()` of `TXUGCPublish`.

```java
mVideoPublish.canclePublish();
```

To resume an upload, call `publishVideo` of `TXUGCPublish` again using the same upload parameters, with video and cover paths unchanged.

### Resume upload from breakpoint

VOD supports resuming upload from breakpoint. When an upload is interrupted unexpectedly, you can upload the file again from the point where the upload is interrupted to avoid repeated upload. The validity period for resuming upload from breakpoint is one day. If an interrupted upload is resumed within one day after the interruption, it is resumed from the breakpoint. If it is resumed after one day, the video is uploaded from scratch by default.
`enableResume` in the upload parameters is the switch for resuming upload from breakpoint. It is enabled by default.
