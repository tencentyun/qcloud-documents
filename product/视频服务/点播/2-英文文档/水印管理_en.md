After the watermark image is successfully uploaded, you can edit the position of the watermark in the video, set it as the default watermark or delete the watermark.
- **Edit:**Output the X/Y coordinates. The X/Y values (in percentage) refer to the position of the watermark image relative to the upper left corner of the video file.
>For example, if X=0% and Y=0%, the watermark is positioned at the upper left corner of the video file; if X=100% and Y=100%, the watermark is positioned at the lower right corner of the video file. The above preview shows how a watermark is positioned in a 1280*720 HD video file and is only for your reference. For the video files of other sizes, watermarks are added based on their relative positions (percentage).

When configured, the watermark applies to all the subsequent videos. To change the watermark, modify the default watermark image.
