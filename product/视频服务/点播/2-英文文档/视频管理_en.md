Log in to Tencent Cloud [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod), click "Video Management" in the left menu bar to go to the cloud video management page. In this page, you can find all the videos sorted by update time by default. In the list, you can view the thumbnails (the figure is only an example), names/IDs, current statuses, duration, original video sizes, categories and creation time of the videos. You can also query and manage videos by such criteria as file names and IDs.
In the cloud video management page, you can perform **Transcoding**, **Deleting**, **Category Setting**, **Applying Web Player**, and **Exporting File Addresses as CSV** for video files. Here are detailed instructions on video management.

## Video Transcoding
By default, after being uploaded, the videos are transcoded based on the transcoding settings in the ["Global Settings"](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/14058). If the transcoding settings have been modified, you can select the videos and then click the "Transcode" button at the top of the page to transcode them again.

## Deleting Video
If a video is no longer needed, you can delete it to free the storage space. Select the video file to be deleted, and click the "Delete" button at the top of the page, and then click "OK" in the pop-up box to delete the selected video.
