Video URL posting in WeChat official accounts is one of the key features of Tencent Cloud video service. In order to guarantee the message posted in the official accounts, WeChat currently only allows certain video URLs to be published as message contents in the official accounts.

Through the video URL posting in WeChat official accounts of Tencent Cloud video service, users can easily generate a dedicated message posting URL in the official accounts for videos already stored in Tencent Cloud to post video contents in official accounts. Before using this feature, you must first complete the individual or enterprise verification in your Tencent Cloud video service account through Console - User Center - Account Information. 

After verification, users can generate a URL on a specific file management page. The system will automatically select the MP4 file with higher bit rate to convert and generate a dedicated URL. The process takes no more than 4 hours. When the URL is generated, users can view it on the corresponding file page in Video Management and preview it through its QR code. Users can copy the URL to the information posting page in WeChat official accounts to post the video.

>Note: After the URL is generated, it will automatically be published. Users can also suspend or resume the posting of URL in official accounts without deleting the source video file. If the original video file is suspended from posting on the video management page, the corresponding URL posting in official accounts will be suspended accordingly; the posting can also be resumed. If the original video file is deleted, the corresponding URL in official accounts will become invalid and cannot be resumed. After posting, the corresponding video file will also be posted to Tencent video platform.
