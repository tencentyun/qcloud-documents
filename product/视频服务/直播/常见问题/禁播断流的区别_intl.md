## 1. Stream Interruption
If a stream that is being broadcasted is interrupted, the push stops and viewers are unable to watch the LVB. When a stream interruption occurs, a push can be initiated at the VJ end to resume the LVB.

## 2. Stream Suspension
If a stream that is being broadcasted is suspended, the push stops and viewers are unable to watch the LVB. When a stream suspension occurs, no push can be initiated at the VJ end during a certain period of time. The end time of suspension can be set on the console and the suspension period cannot be greater than one month.
For example, if stream suspension is enabled for the Stream test123 at 2018-01-01 12:00, and the end time of suspension is set to 2018-01-05-12:00, the VJ for this stream cannot push stream and viewers cannot watch the LVB during this period.
