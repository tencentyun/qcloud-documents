### Step 2: Submit business information

After passing the verification, you need to submit business information, including user type, enterprise name and other application information. The LVB service employs approval mechanism. The final approval result is sent to you via SMS message or email within 5 work days, including a conclusion indicating whether you get the approval or not.

## Renewal
If your account becomes in arrears, you can directly click **Billing Center** -> **Renew** at the upper right corner.

## Arrears
LVB service is suspended in real time when your account becomes in arrears. An message indicating the overdraft of your account will appear on the status interface of the console.
In this case, you can still create channels and manage existing channels, but the downstream LVB service is suspended. You are recommended to monitor the current traffic status in real time and ensure that the traffic is available.
