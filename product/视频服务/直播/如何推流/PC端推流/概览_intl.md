Tencent Cloud PC LVB is used to push compressed and encoded video streams (such as live events, teaching, slides or games) to the push URL of Tencent Video Cloud by using push software OBS (recommended) or XSplit on PCs (Windows/Mac). Viewers can watch the real-time streams using the playback URL corresponding to the push URL.
