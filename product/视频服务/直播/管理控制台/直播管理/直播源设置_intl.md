LVB source name: Used as an ID. The system supports only one LVB source.
Protocol type: RTMP push and FLV/HLS/RTMP pull features are supported.

If RTMP push is selected, the system automatically generates a push address. This address is displayed after the configuration is completed. You can copy this address and configure it on an existing server, RTMP encoder or software. If FLV/HLS/RTMP pull is selected, you need to enter the existing FLV/HLS/RTMP public network address, so that the system can pull the video stream from that address.
