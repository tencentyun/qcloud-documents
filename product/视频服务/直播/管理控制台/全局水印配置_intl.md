You can set the watermark style in Global Settings, including pattern and location. Watermark images in PNG format are supported with maximum file size of 200 KB and pixel size of 200*200. After the configuration is completed, you can apply it to channels in Channel Configuration or Channel Status Modification interface.
You can set one of the watermarks as the default watermark. Once the default watermark is set, all newly created channels use the watermark by default. You can also select another watermark in the configuration via the drop-down box, or choose not to use watermark, as shown below:
