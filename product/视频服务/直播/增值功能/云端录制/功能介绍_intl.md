Recording & Replay means recording user's entire LVB and replaying it as VOD.

At the early stage after an App is launched, there are very few VJs, so adding record playback in the LVB list can enrich the App resources to some degree for viewers. When the VJs increase to a certain number as the App keeps growing, the accumulation of great LVB contents is still indispensable. In addition to name, photos and other personal information in the profile of VJs, the playback of historical LVB videos is also an essential part.
