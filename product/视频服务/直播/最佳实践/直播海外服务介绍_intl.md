As the underlying audio and video technology matures over the recent years, LVB industry has experienced explosive growth all over the world, and it is common for China's Internet platforms to go global. Going global of domestic service products has also provided the LVB industry with a solid foundation for overseas launch. To expand competitive advantages, LVB companies with extraordinary influence in China have developed global product development plans, while some small LVB platforms that cannot seize the market at home are trying to find a way out for overseas markets. At the same time, foreign LVB platforms are also facing intense competition. Although the three giants YouTube, Periscope and Facebook continue to gain ground, there's still plenty of uncontested market space to be developed by the small and medium-sized LVB platforms. Therefore, Tencent Cloud will continue to increase its resource reserves on overseas LVB, and constantly optimize LVB acceleration performance, to help LVB platforms expand their overseas markets.

In addition to push and playback, the complete LVB service should also include authentication, transcoding, screenshot, recording, callback, porn detection, DRM, and other features. The figure below shows the basic feature module of Tencent Cloud's overseas LVB solution.

The demand of overseas LVB for these basic features is the same as that of domestic LVB, but more challenges are waiting for overseas LVB. This is mainly attributed to vast territory, numerous internal networks and transnational network quality of overseas countries. To reduce latency and stutter and provide stable and reliable services, Tencent Cloud has optimized its **architecture, network, security and resources** for overseas LVB scenarios.

### Multi-center deployment
**Tencent Cloud has completed the construction of multiple data centers in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Germany, Toronto, Silicon Valley, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea, and is expanding its data center footprints in other countries and regions.** Data centers come with all the modules required for overseas LVB. Besides, to serve global users and ensure switching between data centers in case of any exception, the overall architecture has been decentralized. Considering the impact of transnational network quality and stability on LVB latency and stutter, the overseas center nodes are connected via the Direct Connect, and the domestic and overseas nodes are connected via the Direct Connect of relay node in Hong Kong center. The following figure shows an overall architecture.

To intuitively show the performance on the acceleration of overseas center nodes, we compare the statistics of domestic users watching VJ video of the United States. As you can see in the figure below, acceleration via Direct Connect keeps the stutter rate low and the network stable.

### Edge region acceleration
The center nodes can perfectly cover the needs of local users, but the needs of those in the countries of non-central regions are also indispensable. Due to condition restrictions, no center node has been built in these countries and regions, and acceleration points are required. We call them the edge regions, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, the Middle East, India, Africa, and South America, where the quality of transnational networks is relatively poor, and the stutter rate of cross-region pull is quite high. For these edge regions, Tencent Cloud sets priorities for service modules. It gives priority to ensuring that the local valid users can watch LVB, without the need of transnational transmission of local data. Services of other modules are re-pulled from the edge node to the center node, and are finally implemented at the center node. **As you can see from the figure below, after the node acceleration of local region is enabled in the edge regions, the stutter rate is significantly reduced, and the acceleration has outperformed other manufacturers in the industry**.

### Optimal access and disaster recovery/switching
Similar to the case of Mainland China, in many overseas countries, there are multiple ISPs in one region, for example, Thailand's DTAC, AIS, and TURE, Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Mobile, and so-net, as well as Indonesia's Telkomsel, XL, and INDOSAT. Access between these ISPs may be limited by bandwidth and resources. To improve the access experience of their users, the scheduling system should allow users to access different ISPs. At the same time, the acceleration points built locally should be accessed via BGP and establish peering link with local ISPs. Cross-provider
For example, for users of three ISPs (DTAC, AIS, and TURE) in Thailand, the central scheduling system collects a large number of foreign IPs and ISPs, and automatically schedules the nearest CDN nodes based on user IPs, with a recognition accuracy of over **99.5%**. Switching between data centers in case of exception is also supported. When the monitoring and detecting node finds an exception in a region, the system automatically selects the optimal data center to switch.

### Network transmission optimization
In case of cross-region overseas public network transmission, traditional TCP transmission cannot maintain low transmission latency. Due to long overseas transmission distance, limits on international egress bandwidth, and frequent fluctuations of network quality, TCP has a long upgrading and optimization period and a poor performance in case of high packet loss. Therefore, Tencent Cloud uses QUIC (reliable data transmission based on UDP) to optimize overseas network transmission. Since the proxy acceleration of upper-level data using QUIC is implemented at the application layer, any changes to parameters or congestion algorithm will take effect immediately. The algorithm parameters can be adjusted to effectively respond to high-latency and high-packet loss scenarios, while avoiding head-of-line blocking and reducing RTT time consumption. **With the calculation of actual data, compared with the traditional TCP, the connection time and stutter rate of the optimized solution is reduced by an average of 40% and 20% respectively.**

The figure below shows a comparison of stutter rates for global users watching the VJ video when the UAE VJ pushes streams to the UAE acceleration point. From the comparison data, the stutter rate remains stable when streams are accelerated via QUIC.

### Massive resource reserve
In addition to technical architectures and solutions, resource reserves are more important to LVB. If there are no overseas resources used as the underlying support, all technologies are merely theories. As mentioned in the Tencent Cloud global node distribution chart at the beginning of the article: **relying on the Tencent Cloud's overseas strategy and long-term overseas investment, it has built more than 900 transmission nodes in more than 40 countries and regions, with a total bandwidth of over 70T, more than 50 global ISP partners, and over 100 overseas acceleration points**. At the same time, Tencent Cloud cooperates with multiple ISPs in the same region. At least 3 copies of disaster recovery backup data are available in each egress to ensure the stable and reliable service.
