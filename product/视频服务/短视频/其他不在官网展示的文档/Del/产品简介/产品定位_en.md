However, to achieve good results in business, developers still need to rely on the cloud, the client, and data, which cost no less than large-scale VOD/LVB applications, and more features are required for the client.

This is why we introduce the UGSV service. It helps developers to build a solid infrastructure so that they can concentrate on short video content operation and gameplay development.

The short video SDK, i.e. the "tool" layer, acts as a connector between the cloud, data and gameplays and provides an access entity for the realization of the whole business scenario. Developers can use the access service at the client to obtain the one-stop cloud and data layer capabilities.
