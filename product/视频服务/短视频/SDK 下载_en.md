- **Paid**

Compared to the standard version, the paid version adds special face effects based on the proprietary technology of Tencent YouTu Lab, such as eye enlarging, face slimming and motion effect sticker. As the proprietary technology of YouTu Lab is adopted, this version is not provided for free. Decompression password and license are needed for running it. The license fee is about 500,000 yuan/year. At present, the license fee of a similar image processing product in China is around 1 million yuan/year. If you need this version, submit a ticket or contact the customer service by calling 400-9100-100. Later, a business representative provides you with a password of the encrypted package and applies for a trial license for you from YouTu Lab.
