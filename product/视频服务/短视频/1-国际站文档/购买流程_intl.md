## Trial of VOD Service

- For customers who activate Tencent Cloud VOD service for the first time, we provide a 30 CNY voucher for trial use. The voucher is valid for one month.

- After logging in to **Tencent Cloud Console** -> **VOD** successfully, you can start the trial.

## Purchase of VOD Service

- Tencent Cloud Video on Demand (VOD) supports Pay-by-Usage (Postpaid) billing method with daily settlement.

- Pay-by-Usage means you can pay for the service after use. You need to top up your Tencent Cloud account in advance. Every day, the system calculates the actual usage of the previous day, sends bill, settles account, and deducts fees from your account balance based on actual usage.

- For more information on VOD billing, please see: [Price Overview](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/2838)

## Renewal

- To ensure that you can use our service normally, we will suspend the service of customers whose accounts are in arrears, and reclaim the resources allocated to the customers with long-standing arrears. You can top up your Tencent Cloud account to make sure your account balance is adequate for daily deductions.

- If your VOD service has been suspended, you can top up your Tencent Cloud account. The VOD service will be available after you pay off the overdraft.
