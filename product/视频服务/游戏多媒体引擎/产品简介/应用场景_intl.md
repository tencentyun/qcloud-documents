## Table Games
The traditional role-playing table game, Werewolf, now can also be played online. Players greet each other before they start, speak in turn during the game, and summarize the game after it is ended. This cannot take place without interaction using real-time voice and video chat. GME provides real-time audio-video services that focus on picture clarity and sound quality. The services are specifically customized for such table games so that players' needs for audio-video interaction are met.

## Casual Games
In chess and cards, karaoke, music, and other casual games, voice messages and voice talkback are also indispensable. In some casual games, VJs may play songs for players, or join karaoke games with backing tracks. GME not only provides real-time audio-video chats for users, but also offers other interesting features, including in-ear monitoring and voice changing, to guarantee the best casual gaming experience.

## E-Sports
In e-sports games, battle situations are constantly changing and players in the same camp need to share their strategies against the enemy in real time. GME makes this possible by implementing real-time in-game free voice chat that features ultra-low latency and prioritized smoothness, allowing players to better communicate with each other and enjoy the battle games.

## Commander Games
MMORPG is a typical example of commander games. Since these games involve squads, gangs, and many other playing modes, they have a higher requirement for voice latency. GME offers real-time automatic broadcasting joining/quitting and voice calls with ultra-low latency. These features can perfectly meet players' voice chat requirements during commander games when a large number of players are online at the same time.
