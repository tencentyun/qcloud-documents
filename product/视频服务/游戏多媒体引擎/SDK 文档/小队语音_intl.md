## Overview
Thank you for using Tencent Cloud Game Multimedia Engine SDK. This document provides a detailed description that makes it easy for developers to debug and integrate the GME APIs for team chatting.

### Enter a room
This function is used to enter a room with the generated authentication data.


### Voice chat room
#### Function prototype
```
ITMGContext EnterRoom(int roomId, ITMG_ROOM_TYPE roomType, byte[] authBuffer)

- If you have special requirements for volume types or scenarios, contact the customer service.
- The sound effect in a game depends directly on the sampling rate set on the console. Please confirm whether the sampling rate you set on the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gamegme) is suitable for the project's application scenario.


### Team chatting room
#### Description:
Team chatting: Players form a team before the game starts, and the team chatting can only be heard by team members;
Global chatting: A player can set this mode before the game starts and during the game. After setting, this player can be heard by all the players within a certain range of his/her voice.
The voice mode can be switched at any time during the game.

#### Suppose player A is in a global chatting mode, the interaction status between player A and player B varies with the scenario and player B's voice chat mode, as shown below:

| In the Same Team | Within the Range | B's Voice Chat Mode | A Can Hear B | B Can Hear A |
| -----------------	| ------------ | ------------ |--------------------------	|--------------------------	|
| Yes | Yes | Global | Yes | Yes |
| Yes | Yes | Team | Yes | Yes |
| Yes | No | Global | Yes | Yes |
| Yes | No | Team | Yes | Yes |
| No | Yes | Global | Yes | Yes |
| No | Yes | Team | No | No |
| No | No | Global | No | No |
| No | No | Team | No | No |

#### Suppose player A is in a team chatting mode, the interaction status between player A and player B varies with the scenario and player B's voice chat mode, as shown below:

| In the Same Team | Within the Range | B's Voice Chat Mode | A Can Hear B | B Can Hear A |
| -----------------	| ------------ | ------------ |--------------------------	|--------------------------	|
| Yes | Yes | Global | Yes | Yes |

>- To set the range for receiving voice, refer to API: SetGameAudioRecvRange.

#### Function prototype
