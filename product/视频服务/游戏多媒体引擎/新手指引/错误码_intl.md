## GMESDK Client Errors
| Error Code Name | Error Code Value | Description | Reason | Solution |
|--------|----|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| AV_ERR_FAILED | 1 | General error | Find the specific reason by analyzing log | Analyze log |
| AV_ERR_REPEATED_OPERATION | 1001 | Repeated operation | "This error occurs while performing a certain operation if the same operation is already in process. For example, this error occurs while performing the operation of joining room if you are joining the room. Operations are mainly categorized into four types: AVContext type, room type, device type, and member type. Operations of AVContext Type: StartContext/StopContext. Operations of Room Type: EnterRoom/ExitRoom. Operations of Device Type: Start/shut down a device. Operations of Member Type: Request for/cancel video images." | Perform the next operation after the previous operation has been completed |
| AV_ERR_EXCLUSIVE_OPERATION | 1002 | Exclusive operation | This error occurs while performing a certain operation if another operation of the same type is already in process. For example, this error occurs while performing the operation of exiting room if you are joining the room. | Perform the next operation after the previous operation has been completed |
| AV_ERR_HAS_IN_THE_STATE | 1003 | Already in the desired status | This error occurs while performing the operation that allows an object to join a certain status if the object is already in this status. For example, this error occurs while performing the operation of joining room if you are already in the room. | Since you are already in the desired status, this operation can be considered to be successful and treated as a success. |
| AV_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT | 1004 | Invalid parameter | This error occurs while passing an invalid parameter if you are calling a SDK API. For example, this error occurs if the passed room type is not AVRoom::ROOM_TYPE_PAIR or AVRoom::ROOM_TYPE_MULTI when you are joining the room. | Read the API documentation carefully, make clear of the valid value range of each parameter for each API, determine which parameters are not specified as required, ensure the correctness of passed parameters, and perform corresponding preventive measures. |
| AV_ERR_TIMEOUT | 1005 | Timeout | This error occurs if the operation result has not been returned within a specific period of time. In most cases, this error tends to occur in scenarios where signaling transmission is involved and network problem occurs. For example, this error occurs if you have not joined the room in 30 seconds after performing the operation of joining room. | Check whether a network problem occurred, and try again. |
| AV_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED | 1006 | Not implement | This error occurs while calling a SDK API if the corresponding feature is not yet supported. | This feature is not supported, so please find an alternative solution. |
| AV_ERR_NOT_IN_MAIN_THREAD | 1007 | Not in main thread | The external SDK API is required to be called in the main thread. This error occurs if this SDK API is not called in the main thread. | Modify the service logic to ensure the SDK API is called in the main thread |
| AV_ERR_RESOURCE_IS_OCCUPIED | 1008 | Resources are occupied | This error occurs if certain resources such as camera and screen have been occupied when needed | Determine which resources are used and occupied by whom, to make sure that the SDK-related features are used at the right time and no conflict occurs when resources are used. |
| AV_ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_EXIST | 1101 | Invalid AVContext status | This error occurs while calling an API that can be called only if the AVContext object is in CONTEXT_STATE_STARTED status when the object is not in such status | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_STOPPED | 1102 | Invalid AVContext status | This error occurs while calling an API that can be called only if the AVContext object is in CONTEXT_STATE_STOPPED status when the object is not in such status. If the object is not in such status, this error occurs while calling AVContext::DestroyContext. | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_ROOM_NOT_EXIST | 1201 | Invalid AVRoom status | This error occurs while calling an API that can be called only if the AVRoom object is in ROOM_STATE_ENTERED status when the object is not in such status | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_ROOM_NOT_EXITED | 1202 | Invalid AVRoom status | This error occurs while calling an API that can be called only if the AVRoom object is in ROOM_STATE_EXITED status when the object is not in such status. If the object is not in such status, this error occurs while calling AVContext::StopContext. | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_NOT_EXIST | 1301 | Device does not exist | This error occurs while using a device that does not exist or has not been initialized | Check whether the device exists, make sure that device ID is entered correctly, and ensure that the device is used after it is successfully initialized. |
| AV_ERR_ENDPOINT_NOT_EXIST | 1401 | AVEndpoint object does not exist | This error occurs while obtaining the AVEndpoint object of a member when the member is not sending any audio or video | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_ENDPOINT_HAS_NOT_VIDEO | 1402 | Member does not send a video | This error occurs while performing the operation that requires a member to send a video if he or she is not sending any videos. For example, this error occurs while requesting a member's screen if he or she is not sending any videos. | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_TINYID_TO_OPENID_FAILED | 1501 | Failed to transfer tinyid to identifier | You need to transfer tinyid to identifier when receiving the signaling of information update of a member. This error occurs in case of IMSDK-related logic problem or network problem. | Check whether a network problem occurs, and view the log to confirm whether problems exist in IMSDK-related logic. |
| AV_ERR_OPENID_TO_TINYID_FAILED | 1502 | Failed to transfer identifier to tinyid | You need to transfer identifier to tinyid when calling the API StartContext. This error occurs in case of IMSDK-related logic problem or network problem or if the user has not logged in. | Check whether a network problem occurs, view the log to confirm whether problems exist in IMSDK-related logic, and determine whether you have called IMSDK's login API successfully. |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_TEST_NOT_EXIST | 1601 | Invalid AVDeviceTest status | This error occurs while calling an API that can be called only if the AVDeviceTest object is in DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STARTED status when the object is not in such status | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_TEST_NOT_STOPPED | 1602 | Invalid AVDeviceTest status | This error occurs while calling an API that can be called only if the AVDeviceTest object is in DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STOPPED status when the object is not in such status. If the object is not in such status, this error occurs while calling AVContext::StopContext. | Modify the service logic to ensure that the SDK API is called at a right time |
| AV_ERR_INVITE_FAILED | 1801 | Failed to send the invitation | A failure occurred while sending an invitation | The invitation module is only used in DEMO. The invitation feature is not supported externally, so this error can be ignored. |
| AV_ERR_ACCEPT_FAILED | 1802 | Failed to accept invitation | A failure occurred while accepting an invitation | The invitation module is only used in DEMO. The invitation feature is not supported externally, so this error can be ignored. |
| AV_ERR_REFUSE_FAILED | 1803 | Failed to refuse the invitation | A failure occurred while refusing an invitation | The invitation module is only used in DEMO. The invitation feature is not supported externally, so this error can be ignored. |
| QAV_ERR_NOT_TRY_NEW_ROOM | 2001 | Not try to join a new room, so stay in the original room. | Failed to switch to the new room, but still stay in the current room. | Features are normal in the current room |
| QAV_ERR_TRY_NEW_ROOM_FAILED | 2002 | Try to join a new room but failed, and the original room is about to be closed | Failed to switch to the new room, but exited the original room successfully | Exit the room and join it again |
