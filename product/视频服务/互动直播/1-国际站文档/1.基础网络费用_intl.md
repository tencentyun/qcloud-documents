### Example of Estimation of Bandwidth Consumption:
If the **playback bitrate of customer's ILVB business at viewer end is set to 1 MB**, when **100 viewers watch video at a certain time at the same time**, the bandwidth consumed at this point of time is **1*100=100 MB**, and so on. The bandwidth usage is collected every 5 minutes, and the peak bandwidth of the month can be used to calculate the monthly fee.
>Note: The billing value of ILVB bandwidth is either uplink bandwidth peak or downlink bandwidth peak of the current month, whichever is larger.

Note: If you have a high volume of business, contact your Tencent Cloud account manager to negotiate for a lower price.

## Note:
### a. Monthly Peak Bandwidth:
•	At DC and OC, peak bandwidth value (in Mbps) is collected every 5 minutes. The highest value of the month is used as the monthly peak bandwidth of DC for billing.
### b. Data Center (DC)
•	It can send uplink/downlink audio and video data, being suitable for multi-person audio/video interaction.

**Scenarios where DC is largely used:**
(1) When viewers have permission to send uplink audio and video

**Note**: Whether viewers join the broadcasting is set and switched by developer. A wrong setting may cause large traffic to flow through DC. Be sure to carefully read the setting method: [click here to read](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/268/7651)

(2) If no uplink audio/video traffic is generated, when the number of room members is small (for example, not more than 5), the traffic flows following a path of VJ -> DC -> OC -> viewer, but the use of OC can cause a waste of traffic from DC to OC. Therefore, in this case, DC is directly used to send downlink traffic.

(3) Schedule the small sized ISP to DC for keeping accessing result.

### c. Outer Center (OC)
•	It can only send downlink audio/video data, being suitable for scenarios where viewers only watch the video.
(As shown in the figure, if no viewer sends uplink video data, and the number of online members in the room is more than 5, most of traffic is generated from OC. But a certain proportion of bandwidth comes from DC -> OC, which accounts for almost 10%)


### d. Traffic Diagram
#### (1) A room with more than 5 people where joint broadcasting is not implemented

#### (2) A room with not more than 5 people where joint broadcasting is not implemented
In case of a small number of room members, use of OC may cause a waste of the traffic from DC -> OC. In this case, DC is directly used to send downlink traffic.
