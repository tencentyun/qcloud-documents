# Porn Detection Service
Porn detection service is an ILVB-based security service, which can be activated independently based on your needs. You can make configurations independently under each sdkappid of ILVB.

## Composition of Porn Detection
1. **Screenshot feature:** The basic capacity of porn detection (required). After an ILVB room is created, it captures the screen at regular intervals at the server end for future detection
2. **Screenshot storage feature:** It is used to store the captured images (required). As required by related national department, the captured images need to be stored for a period of time. Customers can set a longer storage period based on their needs
3. **Automatic porn detection feature**: Optional. After the capture and storage of an image, the level of porn is determined through artificial intelligence, to help customer's reviewers narrow the scope of review and improve efficiency
4. **Manual review service**: Optional. If customers don't have enough auditors, we can provide manual service to review the captured images
