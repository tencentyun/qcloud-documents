## Overview of Additional Capacity
Currently, additional capacities of ILVB include non-interactive broadcasting and recording. A certain fee is charged if these two capacities are used in customer's product.
More additional capacities are available for customers to choose in the future, such as porn detection. Each capacity has independent billing rules.

## 1. Billing of Non-interactive Broadcasting

With **cloud LVB capacity**, non-interactive broadcasting is used to implement audio/video playback outside the ILVB room. [See overview about non-interactive broadcasting](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/268/7612)

So non-interactive broadcasting is charged according to the billing standard of cloud LVB, that is:

### 1. Traffic Fee
<font size=4 color=#008c00>Traffic price: 1.1 CNY/GB</font> (Note, the unit is GB, not bps. Please set it apart from the unit of bandwidth). [See cloud LVB price](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/267/%E4%BB%B7%E6%A0%BC%E6%80%BB%E8%A7%88#.E5.90.8E.E4.BB.98.E8.B4.B9.E6.8C.89.E9.9C.80.E4.BB.98.E8.B4.B9)

Notes:
(1) Billing item: Traffic consumed during ILVB
(2) Billing method: Postpaid
(3) Billing period: On a monthly basis
(4) Complimentary 10 GB traffic for new users (shared in cloud LVB)

### 2. Channel Fee

(1) Billing
Tencent Cloud LVB service provides each account with five free channels for debugging.**That is, an ILVB room occupies a channel for non-interactive broadcasting. If more than five channels are used for non-interactive broadcasting each month, the customer needs to pay the channel fee**.

We charge 60 CNY/channel/month (based on the channels actually used in push). In addition, every 50 MB concurrent bandwidth can deduct the fee of one channel

>For example, if a customer uses 12 channels for non-interactive broadcasting in a month, and the current bandwidth is less than 50 MB, the monthly channel fee is calculated as follows: (12-5)*60=420 CNY

(2) Upper limit of concurrent channels
Currently, the concurrent channels of each customer is limited to 100 (i.e. if 100 ILVB rooms initiate non-interactive broadcasting concurrently, all these 100 channels are occupied). If the number of concurrent rooms exceeds this value, the limit of channels should be raised. Contact us via QQ by adding 3358225043 and tell us your company name and ILVB channel
