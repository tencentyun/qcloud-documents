### What is ILVB?
ILVB (Interactive Live Video Broadcasting) is the live video broadcasting incorporating audio, video, messaging and other interactive capabilities.<br/>
Ordinary LVB is like a television station transmitting program signals to the audience before the TV set, <br/>
while ILVB is like the Spring Festival Gala stage, where performers and audience can interact with each other  and the programmes are recorded and broadcast live to audience for watching.<br/>
An ILVB room supports playback of up to 8 audio and video streams in parallel, with a concurrency of a maximum of 100 million people. This makes ILVB very suitable for such applications as large live show, social video, online education, remote consultation and multi-camera online media rebroadcasting.
