## Requirement of Wechat Pay for the Licence of LVB Customers ##

As required by People's Bank of China for the enterprises with payment license, merchants who use payment system shall not be engaged in the distribution of illegal content.

Therefore, if customers who connect to ILVB, especially those who create data using UGC, receive money through WeChat Pay, they need to provide valid "Network Culture Operation License" to WeChat Pay.

If customers fail to provide this license, after any illegal content is reported during the operation process, WeChat Pay will suspend their payment feature upon verification. To avoid unnecessary loss, ILVB customers should get the "Network Culture Operation License" as soon as possible while strengthening the control of content, and submit the license to WeChat Pay management team.
