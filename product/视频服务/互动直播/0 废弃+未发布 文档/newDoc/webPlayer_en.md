## Web Video Playback

ILVB is essentially private protocol, so it is very hard to support ILVB on web, especially in WeChat and Mobile QQ.<br/>
For this reason, [Non-interactive Broadcasting API](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/268/7612) is required to convert private protocol video streams into standard protocol video streams on Tencent Cloud server in order to watch them.<br/>

## Web Player

We provide [Player SDK](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/5704) used for watching videos on web.

## Message Interaction on Web

Demo is currently under preparation. For now, you can refer to [Instant Messaging Web SDK](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/269/1594).
