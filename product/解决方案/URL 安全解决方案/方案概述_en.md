## Solution Overview
The Tencent Cloud URL Security Solution can effectively optimize the algorithm for malicious content identification through its in-depth learning capability, and use the multi-dimensional malicious content detection engine system developed by Tencent over many years to perform quick security detection on the website URLs submitted by developers, so as to accurately identify the malicious resource information (such as pornography, embedded Trojan, fraud, induced sharing, illegal mutual repulsion, illegal distribution, collection of likes) in the website URLs, and actively return the detection results to developers. Meanwhile, for the URLs blocked by the Tencent platform, after developers have confirmed the malicious behavior to be corrected, Tencent Cloud can provide a customer service staff to offer exclusive assistance with a view to facilitate the process and ensure the implementation of operation plans.

## Solution Principle
Before the URL resources are published, developers submit the URLs to be published to Tencent Cloud for detection. Tencent Cloud can quickly identify pornography, embedded Trojan, fraud, induced sharing and other malicious behaviors in the URLs. At the same time, users can submit the domain names that need to be monitored, and Tencent Cloud will actively monitor all the URLs under these domain names. Once a malicious behavior is found, users will be notified of this for processing in real time.

| Advantage | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Multi-Dimensional Intelligent Detection System | Relying on the powerful recognition capability of the multi-dimensional malicious content detection engine system developed by Tencent over many years, it can run a full scan of the URL security through multi-dimensional detection, such as content filtering, image recognition, Trojan detection, website credit investigation, and public opinion monitoring. |
| Automatic monitoring of the entire site | Tencent Cloud implements proactive full-site monitoring to a domain name with the ownership verified by a developer. When a malicious URL under the domain name is found, it immediately reports the detection result to the developer. |
| Complete unblocking system | When an URL is blocked by all marketing platforms, the developer can modify the malicious information to ensure the elimination of malicious content. Then, the developer can speed up the processing through the exclusive unblocking channel provided by Tencent Cloud. |

## Scope
Tencent Cloud URL Security Solution is under internal trial. Users who have passed the Tencent Cloud enterprise verification can apply for free trial.

## Application Scenarios
Tencent Cloud URL Security Solution can be used for any scenarios that require URL security detection. To ensure the normal implementation of developers' operation plans on the Tencent Cloud platform, we need to perform an automatic and intelligent security detection on the URLs submitted by developers. The real time monitoring of URLs allows developers to obtain the risk information during the distribution of URLs in real time and make a quick response.
