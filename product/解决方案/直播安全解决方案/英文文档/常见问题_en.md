### How to minimize omissions in manual review?
In traditional mode, reviewers need to continuously watch the video or images, fatigue and interruption are inevitable. While BSP LVB monitoring system can ensure a high coverage and a healthy operation of the platform with a 24/7 machine recognition and highlighted warning.

### How to save review manpower?
The ordinary manual review mode requires a great deal of manpower to find suspicious rooms from massive videos or screenshots. With Cloud Image's porn detection feature integrated, BSP LVB monitoring system can find suspicious rooms from a large amount of room screenshots, decrease manpower, and complete the second review and processing with fewer manpower.

### How to ensure timely porny LVB detection?
Screenshots of all LVB rooms will be captured and recognized on Tencent LVB platform. Once suspicious rooms are found, they will be pushed to reviewers for processing through the review platform, ensuring second-level responding to porny LVB detection.

### How to increase efficiency of manual review?
BSP LVB security solution picks out the highly suspicious porny rooms with Cloud Image's porn detection engine. Reviewers can manually review these rooms at first priority.

### How to assess the quantity of screenshots?
Total number of screenshots = Total LVB time (sec) / screenshot capturing intervals (sec)

Total LVB time = Cumulative sum of LVB time of all rooms

For example, the total time of LVB on a platform is 2,000 hours, and the screenshot capturing intervals is 10 seconds, the total number of screenshots is: 2,000 \* 60 \* 60 / 10 = 7,200,000.
